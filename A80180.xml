            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By which the length of the Starres changeth every hondred yeares 1 degree, and 25 minutes, or elſe every 20 yeares 17 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: but their breadth that is the diſtance from the Ecliptique remaineth unchangeable alwayes the ſame. Through the foreſaid change of the length (by length of time) changeth alſo the declination of the one more and alſo ſooner then of the other. Some are made leſſe, and ſome grow bigger. Some of them having Northerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination become ſouther, and ſome others having ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly declination become on the contrary northerly.</p>

D of Aries and H the end of Gemini or beginning of Cancer, let (as is before ſaid the Starre at F its length be in the Ecliptique to L. its breadth by north of it at L F its northerly declination is then V F. If then the foreſaid ſtarre in many yeares runneth in length from F to L paralell with D H its breadth reſteth K T even untill the ſoregoing F L but its declination I T, is more then V F the firſt becauſe that it beeing paralell with D H is more wended from the Equinoctiall line.

<pb facs="tcp:170755:10"/> If a Starre at T having Northerly declination T I runneth in length untill F, its declination F V is leſſe then T I, becauſe it is come nearer the Equinoctiall, then if ſo be that it runneth in length untill B, its deelination which was firſt northerly ſhall then bee ſoutherly from B to D. Through the foreſayd motions of the eigth Spheare changeth alſo the declination of the Northſtarre, which is every yeare greater, that is, hee departeth the longer the more from the Equinoctiall, and commeth neerer the Pole, which ſhall endure to the yeare of our Lord 2091, then ſhall hee bee neareſt and no more then 26 minutes, and a halfe diſtant from it and after that time by little and little ſhall wend from it, ſo that 12700 yeares afterwards it ſhall ſtand from the Pole 47 degrees and 56 minutes. How this commeth to paſſe may plainly bee conceived out of this manner of Figure.</p>

C: N the Pole of the Ecliptique in the middle of the Ecliptique E D G C, H the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre, its breadth from the Ecliptique is Q H 66 degrees and 2 minutes, and its diſtance from the Pole of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes, they remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike even as the breadth and diſtance of all fixed Starres from the Pole of the Zodiaque N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes they remaine alwayes one and the ſame even as the breadth and diſtance of all fixed Starres is from the Zodiaque Pole, as heretofore is ſayd. Its length from the Spring Equinoctiall or beginning of Aries for the yeare 1625. is C Q 83 degrees and 24 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Let there bee drawne a Circle out of N the Pole of the Ecliptique, as I L K O H; whoſe halfe Diameter let bee N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes even to the diſtance of the Northſtarre from the Zodiaque Pole, therein is cloſed the Northpole of the world at A as beeing leſſe different from the Zodiaque Pole then the Northſtarre. Upon the like Circle the Northſtarre taketh his compaſſe about the Pole of the Zodiaque (even as all the fixed Starres in 25400 yeares, its diſtance from the worlds Pole is for the yeare 1625 A H 2 degrees 42 minutes and ſhall in the yeare of our Lord 2091 bee come from H to I beeing then neareſt to the worlds Pole, and ſtands no further of then 26 ½ minut. going forwards from I alongſt to L untill K it ſhall then bee diſtant from the worlds Pole marked with A K 27 degrees and 56 minutes.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the Starres keepe not alwayes one kind of declination, wee have for the furtherance of Mariners prepared theſe two following Tables.

                     <p>Firſt you muſt know that the way of the Sonn in the heaven is immoveable with the fixed Starres with the which it is every day once turned about from eaſt to weſt without change, but onely that the Sonne doth contrary wiſe run this foreſayd yearely courſe from weſt to eaſt Whereby hee in his daily courſe, commeth ſo farr behind, that hee in a whole yeare goeth one courſe leſſe then the fixed Starres: and that the fixed Starres turne once more about in a yeare then the Sunn, ſo that they every day come 4 min. ſooner to the diviſion, that commeth every weeke to about halfe an houre &amp; every month 2 houres, which that it may the better bee underſtood, wee will make it evident by an example taken from the ſtarre cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Syrius, or Canis Major the great dogge, which alwayes followeth a little after the Image of the Gyant Orion and his Girdle, which is called the three Kings, which appeare a little over the great Dogge, it is the greateſt and cleareſt of all the fixed Starres, which for the moſt part is knowne unto all Sea-faring men, his declination is Southward from the Line 16 degrees, and 13 minutes.</p>

                     <p>To finde the houre of the day at any hight, will bee done moſt readily and certainely with ſuch a water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, as is deſcribed in the Chapter of the ebbing &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea; in the night one may finde it by the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, as this Figure above deſcribeth, which hath two rondels; the one moveable, the other immoveable, in the loweſt which is immoveable are the 12 ſignes of heaven placed is alſo the moneths and dayes of the yeere. On the
<pb facs="tcp:170755:13"/> moveable roundel are the houres, this turnes with the gnomen, whoſe right ſide anſwereth to the middle point where there muſt be a nayle with a hole; through which a man may ſee. The uſe of this night diall is this: We ſet firſt the foot to the twelfth houre on the moveable roundel, and to the day of the yeere, on the undermoſt unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble roundel, and ſet the Inſtruments hight, with the loweſt corner of the foot A B, ſo that it ſtand water-pas, in ſuch ſort, that a man may ſee the North-ſtar through the hole of the nayle, turning the diall up and downe, ſo long till the hinder wheeles of the great Wagon come into the diall, which being ſo, the gnomen ſhall ſhew the houre on the moveable roundel. And if in place of the hinder wheels of the Wagon you take the brighteſt of the watchtmen, it will be 4 hour. 15 minut. later, as the diall will ſhew, becauſe the wheeles aforeſayd of the great cart goe ſo much before the wayters.</p>
                     <p>Men may finde the houre by the aſcenſion of the Sunne and the Starres in this manner; when we ſee any Star in the South, whoſe juſt aſcenſion is knowne, and that we know the true aſcenſion that day, then draw the aſcenſion of the Sunne from the aſcenſion of the Star, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we devide into houres by 15, (for 15 degr. make 1 houre) and this wil be the right houre of the time, but if the aſcenſion of the Sunne be more then the Stars, in that cauſe you ſhall add 360 degrees to the aſcenſion of the Star, and then to as aforeſayd.</p>

                        <hi>The</hi> 24 <hi>Point.</hi> Of the cutting of the Croſſe-ſtaffe, and how a man may helpe and prevent all the defects of the ſtaffe.</head>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Set the great Croſſe with the middlemoſt upon like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to wit, each upon ſuch as for that purpoſe are mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſtaffe: then apply the ſtaffe (the Croſſes ſo firmely remaining) unto your eye in ſuch manner (whether it bee on the innermoſt or outermoſt corner it is all one) as that you diſcerne the ends of the Croſſes both above and beneath, juſt over each other, in forme as this figure ſpecifieth. If then you draw ſtrait lines by the ends of of the Croſſes A B and D C they ſhall meet juſt in the middle point of your ſight. And in aſmuch as the Croſſes are placed upon like degrees, the lines aforeſaid ſhall meet juſt upon the end of the ſtaffe, ſeeing that the end of the ſtaffe repreſenteth the center of the quadrant whereby your ſtaffe is marked.</p>
                     <p>So then the aforeſaid lines or ends of the Croſſes anſwer both juſt upon the end of the ſtaffe, &amp; alſo upon the ſight, ſo that it followeth neceſſarily, and appeareth evidently: that the end of the ſtaffe and the ſight meet in one; or to ſpeake properly, both of them ſtand juſt in the center of the quadrant.</p>
                     <p>Therefore whenſoever with the Croſſe ſtaffe you will take the height of the Sun, or of any Star, then obſerve diligently: how many degrees it is elevated above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: and place the two Croſſes upon ſo many degrees: then apply the ſtaffe to your eye in ſuch manner as that you may ſee the ends of the Croſſes juſt over each other, according as is taught before: in ſuch forme then as you finde the ſtaffe to ſtand to your eye ſhall you place the ſtaffe (taking away one of the Croſſes) when you deſire to meaſure according to ſuch height: this is a ſure rule which will never fayle, neither can you poſſibly miſſe if you follow it.</p>

                     <p>That being done, the preparation is made; to marke the peece, take firſt the juſt wideneſſe with a paire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, that is betweene EG, the foremoſt edge of the long croſſe, and A B the outermoſt edge of the eare, in the little croſſe, as in the figure N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. and put that on the peece of the point D, on the left roundell inward toward C, on that point draw a thwart line, from thence you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to marke, that the wideneſſe betweene the middle line of the ſtaffe, and the under edge of the eare, which is in the uppermoſt croſſe, as in the foreſaid figure N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. from F tot A, prick that on the quadrant from A toward F in H, and from C to G in I, and draw the line H I. Then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how all the lines comming from A the center of the quadrant, cutting through this line, even ſo muſt the peece bee marked beginning at the point C with 90, 80, 70, &amp;c. But if ſo doing, you cannot get ſo many degrees on the ſtaffe, as you deſire to have (for your uſe) then ſet the little croſſe a third or fourth part lower toward the great croſſe at your pleaſere, ſo that the under edge of the eare AB in the figure N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. may come to ſtand at MN, then in the place of the length F A take F M, and thruſt it in the quadrant of A toward F into K, and from C unto L, and draw the line K L, that then will bee marked as it ought, by cutting the lines, comming from the center through the deviſion of the quadrant, but you muſt take a certaine marke in the long croſſe, for to ſet the little croſſe in ſuch manner as you would uſe both marking. But if you would make more markes on the ſame peece, you muſt ſlide that little croſſe more netherward and then doe as was ſaid before, but you may not forget to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine markes in the long croſſe; for to ſet the little croſſe wel according to the marking, which you deſire to uſe.</p>
                     <p>To marke this croſſe ſtaffe from tables more perfectly, draw on an even board paſted with paper a right or ſtraight line, as long or longer then the ſtaffe that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to marke. You ſhall with the compaſſe take the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſtaffe, between the middle line, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt edge of the eare at the little croſſe, as it is in the figure N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. F A or F M, or alſo F O, what marking ſoever you deſire to follow ſet that wideneſſe taken as often alongſt that foreſaid line as you can, and each of theſe lengths you ſhall divide in 10000 parts, this table in this place ſhewes how many of theſe parts you ſhall appoint for a degree, or a fourth part of a degree, beginning, as is the figure a foreſayd N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. from the point C. The firſt Columne of the table ſheweth the degrees, the ſecond the min. the third the parts, which you muſt take for the degrees, and mi. for the firſt halfe degree or 30 min. 87, for a degrees, 175. for 2 degr. 15 mi. 393, but for 6. degrees, 45. min. 1184. parts; but if you cannot divide ſo ſmall a breadth as of F E, or F O, into 10000 parts, then you may divide it into halfe ſo many parts, and ſo you ſhall take ſo many parts for a degree, or part of a degree, if you cannot doe that, you ſhall devide it into 1000 parts, at every time, leaving out one letter in the table, as when you ſhould take for the firſt degree 175. take 17, and as neare, as you can one halfe, for the 8, degrees in the place of 1405, take 140, and ſo forward.</p>

                     <p>But if you marke this ſtaffe with the number inverted, ſo that in the place of 90 you ſet 0 for 80. 10 for 70 20. and ſo forth, as the common croſſe ſtaffe is marked ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, which you uſe toward the Sunne, you muſt then on the contrary uſe the northerly declination, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the ſoutherly and ſo at the firſt without further marking, you have the height as it is in the figure, if as in that which went before you to the height of the Sun being elevated at D 70 gr. you ſhall in place 70 finde on the ſtaffe 20 that is not the height of the Sun from the Horizon B D, but the fulfilling of the height to 90 degrees as D Z, that is the diſtance of the Sun and Zenith, if then you joine to it the northerly declination D E 10 gr. that makes together EZ 30 degrees, the diſtance of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall and Zenith, and juſt at P A the elevation of the Pole. In the ſame manner if the Sun hath ſoutherly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and is riſen from the Horizon 50. gr. as in S. you ſhall not find on the ſtaffe 50 gr. for B S, but 40. gr. for S Z the diſtance of the Sunne and the Zenith. Then if you take S E the ſoutherly declination from S Z 40. there remains E Z 30 degrees, for the diſtance of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall and the Zenith juſt at P A the height of the Pole.</p>
                     <p>That the unſliding peece ſhould be moveable by the ſight it is done for 2. cauſes; firſt that you may ſlide it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward or outward as theſe and ſliding of the great croſſe requireth, ſecondly, that in ſoule weather when the waves goe high, you may ſet it inward (as occaſion ſhall require) for your better meaſuring, for where the waves are high and troubleſom long inſtruments, are not ſo fit for uſe as ſhort. This foreſaid croſſe ſtaffe is very fit, to take the height certainely on the firm land, without the uſe of the Horizon. That you may do this, you ſhall lay the ſtaffe on a table or any other flat place in a rightline with the water the eye end directly to the ſouth, and with the other end, where the thwart ſliding peece ſtandeth to the north, on two ſmooth peeces of wood, ſo much lifted up that you may ſlide the long croſſe too and againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hinderance, then when the Sunne comes directly ſouth, (that is, when the Sunne hath equall ſhadow on each ſide of the ſtaffe, then ſhall you ſlide the long croſſe too and fro, ſo long untill the ſhadow of the eare at the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle croſſe fall juſt betweene the two parrallell lines on the thwart croſſe; that being done, you ſhall finde the height of the Sun in the ſtaffe at the long croſſe, which being ſound, you ſhall by that know the height of the Pole or the diſtance of the place where you take the height ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtructions before laid downe.</p>

Nevertheleſſe the Aſtrolabium can have no ſuch perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it, for the Dioptra in the ſaid Aſtrolabiums are placed almoſt 2 or 3 inches at moſt the one from the other, and if ſo bee, in a little time, a ſmall fault or miſtake happen in the obſervation of the ſhaddows even as through motion of the shipp it may eaſily happen, ſoo alſo muſt the Dioptra upon the degrees of the Limbus make a greater miſtake and fault.</p>
                     <p>Therefore have I here ſet downe this figured and drawne Ring which you may let be made ready or prepared by Meſſig about one foote or a foote &amp; halfe wide and 2 or 3 inches broad. For in the uſe of it you have no neede of a Dioptra but you let the Sonne ſhine through the little holes becauſe the ſhaddow may the more perfectly and narrowly bee obſerved, ſo! then let the ring b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe degrees fall once more wider one from the other then in the Limbus of the Aſtrolabium, becauſe in this the ſhadow falleth out of the circumference; or out of the ſides and not (as it is in the Aſtrolabium) out of the Center, and therefore is the whole circumference of the Ring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Art of Geometry devided into 180 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, whereas on the contrary in the Aſtrolabium the Limbus or round ring encompaſſing it containeth 360 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>

                     <p>The beginning of the degrees beginneth by the letter O, right even againſt the little hole over that which is placed next by the handel: there are 2 little holes or chinkes made in the Ring through which you let the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow fall, the one ſtands by the letter B, placed about 10 degr. from the pendel E, by which the ring is hung. The other little hole C. ſtands juſt 30 degrees diſtant from the little hole. B. Becauſe: when the Sunne is not verry high above the Horiſon, then we receive the ſhaddow through the little hole C, and then wee begin to count the degrees not farre from the letter O, as beforeſaid, but from the letter F, ſtanding right juſt over againſt C. juſt 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe height and breadth of Lands and Countreyes although that in themſelves they are divers things, yet they are allwayes one like unto the other. Any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being ſcituated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lyeth alſo in the height 30 degrees, which by Sea-faring men is taken without difference, but what it is, or what it hath in it or ſignifieth few men underſtand, and yet it behooveth a ſeafaring man, that ſeeketh for the height of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to bee expert therein, for that no man without it can wel underſtand how many inſtruments (whether it be Aſtrolabium, or Croſſe ſtaffe, no nor the Sea-compaſſe it ſelfe) ſhould well be uſed: for that theſe things are all built upon one foundation, and like a chaine hang one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other. But it may be that ſome man will object and ſay, that there are many Pilots which doe not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch things and yet are able to goe directly unto divers places, whether they deſire to ſayle: which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be true: but tell me how many times are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? How many times are they in great doubt &amp; feare? and how ſeldome dare they truſt unto the height which they have taken or reckoned, when they are to ſeeke out any Countrey thereby? how oftentimes hath it heretofore happened, that for want of ſuch knowledge, ſhippes have ſayled out of their way either, behinde England, or upon France, which thought to paſſe through the chanell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and France, and that in ſo ſhort and well knowne, and common ſayled water, as to come out of Spaine or France? what would ſuch men doe, if they ſhould paſſe the Line, and were to ſeeke or finde out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ilands? Or that after they had ſayled up and downe the Seas certaine moneths together, ſhould then ſeeke out for Land? but I am of this opinion which I know eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will grant that it is much better and more aſſured to goe away being guided by his owne eye-ſight, then like a blinde man to bee led by another, and knoweth not whether that other ſeeth well or not: but to come againe to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no other but the height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to ſay, ſo many degrees as the Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizon; ſo much is the height of ſuch a Country: &amp; this height agreeth allwayes with the breadth as aforeſayd. In the 10 Chapter it is ſhewed, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man goeth or turneth, alwayes the one halfe of the Heavens ſheweth it ſelfe above the Horizon and the other halfe is hidden from us: in the firſt chapter it is ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:170755:19"/> that the two Poles ſtand right one againſt the other, whereby it is evidently to be underſtood, that whenſoever a man being upon the earth is right under the Equinoctiall line, that then both the Poles of the World, lye right in the Horizon, one in the ſouth, and the other in the north: and as much as a man travaileth northward from the Equinoctiall line; and winneth breadth northerly, ſo much the north Pole riſeth above the Horizon: and the ſouth Pole contrarywiſe goeth ſo much under: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as many degrees as a man goeth from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall line ſouthward, and winneth breadth ſouthward, ſo much the ſouth Pole riſeth above the Horizon, and the north Pole goeth ſo much under: which may eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the figure here after following.</p>
                     <p>In this figure the innermoſt roundel that turneth about, ſignifieth the Heaven, N the north Pole, S the ſouth Pole, AE the Equinoctiall, the uppermoſt edge of the halfe moveable roundell, ſignifieth the Horizon, the one halfe off the Heavens is above it, and the other halfe juſt under it, the round ball in the middle ſignifieth the earth, where in you ſee a little man, that may be turned upon the earth ſouthward and northward.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Now perfectly to marke and perceive that which is before written, that is to know what height is, and that it alwayes agreeth with the breadth, bring the little man upon the Earth Globe right under the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay that it have no breadth, neither northward nor ſouthward, then you ſhall ſee that both the Poles lye juſt with the Horizon, and that neither of them both are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above it, nor depreſſed under it, and withall, you ſhall ſee that they that dwell under the Equinoctiall have no height or elevation of the Pole, nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man ſo much northward that hee goeth tenne degrees upon the earth, that is, that hee commeth tenne degrees upon the north breadth, you ſhall ſee that the north Pole ſhall bee rayſed or elevated tenne degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the ſouth Pole ſhall goe ten degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the earth more northerly, as thirty, forty, or fifty degrees, the north Pole will alſo be ſo much elevated, and the ſouth Pole to the contrary ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under the Horizon: ſo that if you turne the man upon the earth to ninety degrees, then the north Pole alſo will bee elevated ninety degrees, that is the Pole will ſtand right above his head, and the Equinoctiall will joyne with the Horizon in one circle: that which thus is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>id of the elevating of the north Pole, is alſo in the ſame manner to be underſtood of the ſouth Pole: for if you likewiſe move the man upon the earth in the figure toward the ſouth, the ſouth Pole will be elevated above the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goeth ſouthward, and the north P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>THeſe Tables of the Suns declination are reckoned upon the Meridian or length of the earth from the weſtend of England.

                     <p>On the contrary, thoſe which are more weſterly from thence, have the waxing declination (that is when the Sun runneth from the Line either by North or by South the Line, the greater declination and the falling declination (that is when the Sunne runneth againe towards the Line, either by North or by South the Line, maketh the leſſe. That commeth to paſſe by reaſon of time, thus. Thoſe which are more eaſterly have the Sunne ſooner in the ſouth or in their Meridian, and therefore is the waxing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination leſſe, and the falling greater, on the contrary thoſe which are more weſterly have the Sonne later in the South, and therefore have they the increaſing decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation more, the decreaſing leſſe.</p>

                        <hi>The</hi> 33. <hi>Point.</hi> Of the CARD.</head>
                     <p>IT is knowne to every man, eſpecially to thoſe that derſtand the grounds of Coſmographie, that the
<pb facs="tcp:170755:25"/> earth with the waters make one compleate round body, &amp; therefore it cannot be, that you ſhould ſet forth the ſame perfectly in a plane or Carde (either in the hole or in part) but there will bee ſome want, for it is unpoſſible to make a plaine agree with a round forme in all the parts thereof. So that your common cardes many times fayle in truth, eſpeciall thoſe that comprehend great and long voyages by ſea, and far from the Equinoctiall; but the Maps which are commonly uſed in this Countrey, of the Eaſterly and Weſterly Navigation, are without fault, or at leaſt the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are ſo little that they hinder not.</p>
                     <p>They are very fit inſtruments to bee uſed at ſea, and our forefathers, which have invented them, have brought no ſmall profit and utility to Mariners. The fault of them conſiſts in this, and thus it may bee ſeene: If you would ſayle a triangle, the 2 firſt ſides will bee ſayled on their ſtrokes and diſtances; but from the 2 to the 3 place (that is the 3 ſide of the triangle) it will fayle both on the ſtrokes and diſtances.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Example.</head>
                        <p>I ſayle from the Lizard a ſtraight courſe to the Ilands of Canary, and from thence againe to the Ilands of Corvo and Flores, on which foreſayd ſtroks and diſtances many Maps are very complete and perfect. But if I would ſayle againe from Corvo to the Lizard, from whence I firſt ſailed, the Card will ſhew mee an imperfect way, to wit, it will ſeeme farther wide in the Card, then indeed it is, alſo it will differ on the points of the Compaſſe: ſo that you muſt direct your courſe more northerly then that which your Card directeth.</p>
                        <p>In ſoo ſhort a journey, as this above ſaid, it is not much obſerved, neither is it worth the obſervation: but thoſe that ſail to the Weſt-Indies, ſhall ſoone perceive it; when they ſet ſayle, they take their courſe far to the ſouth, and there they finde their Cards of a fit length, becauſe the Cards are fitted to it; But in their returne, when they take their courſe northward, they finde the way much ſhorter then their Cardes ſhew them.</p>
                        <p>This is the cauſe: All the lines in the Card from north and ſouth are drawne every where at an equall diſtance each from other, from the Equinoctiall to the Pole; but on a globe which is made round like the earth, they are not of an equall diſtance, but the more northerly they come, ſo much the nearer they come each to other. So that two ſtrokes from north to ſouth at the latitude of 60 degrees, are but halfe ſo wide from one another, as they are at the Equinoctiall, and at the Pole they touch each other. Therefore two ſhipps being under the Equinoctiall diſtant from one another two hundred leagues, they may both ſayle directly north without hinderance, comming to the height of 60 gr. but being 100 leagues from each other, and that following the ſame courſe, they would in the end meet each other under the pole, but if you direct ſuch two ſhips by a plaine Carde, they will bee alway at equall diſtance, by which it ſufficiently appeares, that all places lying far north, are much too wide, unleſſe they bee drawne in, which cannot bee done, but you muſt make other places more faulty.</p>

                        <p>The Golden number increaſeth every yeare with the beginning of the yeare with one, as in the yeare 1640, it is 7, 1641 it is 8. and ſo forth to 19, after that againe 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The Epact changeth every yeare on the firſt of March increaſing with 11 to 30, but being more then 30, you muſt leave that 30 and the remainder is the Epact. You ſhall finde it by the golden number thus: tell the golden number on the 3 joynts of your thumme, beginning with one at the lower joynts, unto the golden number of your yeare propoſed, if it doth end this kind of telling at the lower joynt, then the Epact and the golden number are all one: but if it end on the ſecond joynt, adde 10, if on the third joynt, adde 20 by the ſame golden number, that number is the Epact of that yeare.</p>

Betwixt this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd buye upon the Hound and the fourth, lyeth another buye upon the north ſide of the deep, upon the ſouther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt poynt of the New-grounds, which you muſt leave on the larboard ſide, &amp; runne about to the ſouthwards of it. From the buye upon the Hound to the ſixth, the courſe is northnortheaſt, and two fathom deep. From the ſixth to the ſeventh and laſt buye northeaſt and by north, and the deepe alongſt to the northwards of it three fathom. Being paſt the laſt buye, follow the beakons, which ſtand alongſt on the north ſhoare, untill you come to Hulck, runne cloſe alongſt to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or to the eaſtwards of them, for to avoyd a tayle of ſand, which commeth off from the eaſt ſhoare, which men might unawares ſayle within into a Dead-creeke. From the Hulck to Schulperzile, the courſe is eaſt ſoutheaſt. In that reach, the beakons ſtand on the ſouth ſide upon the Ballaſt-plate, and you muſt run alongſt to the northwards by them, leaving them on the larboard ſide. From Schulperzile to Tonningen the courſe is northnortheaſt. Before Tonningen the Eyder is at the ſhoaleſt, and at low water no deeper then one fathom and a halfe. From thence further in towards the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town called Frederick ſtadt, there is depth enough.</p>
                        <p>The depths here before mentioned are all to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at low water. From Tonningen towards Wollerſum, the Eyder lyeth alongſt northeaſt and by eaſt. From Wollerſum towards Harebleck north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northweſt. From Harebleck towards Reymers-bode northeaſt. From Reymers-bode towards Nyenzyle eaſtſoutheaſt. From Nyenzyle to the Nyen-veere ſouth.</p>

Betwixt theſe two beakons goeth in through a deepe ſoutheaſt or ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and by eaſt, where you may ſayle through alongſt by the beakons upon the Iron Hendrick (which you muſt leave then on the ſtarboard ſide) untill you come into the end of the North-pipe, which lyeth from thence about weſt into ſea. You may ſound in at the North-pipe, comming in out of the ſea by the ſouth ſhoare in 3 &amp; 4 fathom, untill you come to the foreſayd beakons, &amp; then about by them northweſt, or ſomewhat more weſterly up unto the Eyder, or elſe you may runne further alongſt by the foreſayd ſouth ſhoare, untill you come about the beakon upon Hoedmeerſand, and then forth betwixt the Iſland Bulheads and Buyſen alongſt by the Beakons upon Hoedmeerſand, with many poynts and bights on to the ſouthwards, and come out at laſt upon the Old Elve, about northeaſt from the New-work againſt the New-grounds, which is not well to bee ſayled, but of thoſe that are there very well acquainted.</p>
                        <p>Alongſt by the North ſhoare of the Eyder, cloſe to the ſouthwards of the little ſand-hills, the ſoutherheads, runneth in yet a Land-deepe, eaſt and eaſt and by north in, &amp; commeth out againe upon the Eyder by the Hulck, that ſerveth but onely for ſmall ſhips, there remaineth at low water but five foot.</p>

This is a good handſome haven, and light for to come into, there it is four and twenty and five and twenty fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>The Longſound is one of the faireſt havens of all Norway, and lyeth northnortheaſt from Jofferland diſtant one great league. Before old Longſound lyeth a high round rocke whereupon ſtandeth a great round Warder,<note place="margin">Coninx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven.</note> for knowledge of this haven.

                     <p>For to ſayle through within Iofferland from Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiell, the Sound lyeth through the channell firſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and northeaſt and by north, and then eaſtnortheaſt, and afterwards againe northeaſt, and then you come to a place where the ſound is ſomewhat broader, there lyeth a ſuncken rock, which you muſt leave on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, and edge to the north ſhoare. Being paſt that, you ſhall come againe in a very narrow ſound, which lyeth through moſt northeaſt, and is at ſome places ſo narrow, that the yard armes doe almoſt touch the rockes.

Betwixt them both lye two havens, Eaſtkiell and Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord, men ſayl in there to the eaſtwards of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocks of Jofferland. From theſe foreſayd northermoſt out-rocks of Jofferland unto Eaſtkiell, it is northweſt about a league, but to Abbefoort northnorthweſt and north and by weſt alſo a league. Men may (comming from the ſouthwards, or from Weſtkiell<note place="margin">Weſtkiel.</note>) ſayle through within Jofferland, into Eaſtkiell, or Abbefoort.</p>
                     <p>When you come before Weſtkiel, you may ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the land three high hills, and alſo the high land of Long-ſound, lying northwards from you, that land is altogether very eaſy to be knowne, he that ſeeth it once, and takes regard of it, ſhall know it very wel another time, when he commeth thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>A league to the eaſtwards of Sandvoort lyeth the haven of Weſtkiell, a little to the eaſtwards of it lyeth Jofferland. For to ſayle into Weſtkiel,<note place="margin">Iofferland</note> you muſt leave all the great rocks (which lie off from Jofferland on the ſtarboard ſide,) and all the foreſayd little rocks of Sandvoort, and alſo a white holme whereupon a maſt ſtandeth on the larboard ſide, and run in firſt northweſt and afterwards northnorthweſt and at laſt north, untill you come about the weſt poynt, and then you muſt edge up northweſt to the north ſide of the Iſlands, which ly within the haven, there is a Voſſe, or an Overfall of water, there you may anchor in twenty or five and twenty fathom.</p>
                     <p>Thwart of Sandvoort lyeth a banck at ſea, which at ſome places is not deeper then three or four fathom, and lyeth alongſt to the eaſtwards untill thwart of Weſtkiell.</p>
                     <p>A great league to the eaſtwards of Sandvoort lyeth Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. For to ſaile in there you muſt leave all the little rocks on the ſtarboard ſide, and run ſo alongſt by the land untill you come within the Long-holms which remain on the larboard ſide, and then right into the Bight. This is a faire haven, men come into it from the eaſtwards.</p>
                     <p>When you are before Oxefordt and Longen,<note place="margin">Markes of Oxeford. &amp; Longe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Longhen.</note> then the Drommels lie about weſtnorthweſt from you.</p>
                     <p>A league to the eaſtwards of Oxeford lyeth Longen before it lieth a little round Iſland or rock on the eaſt ſide of the haven, upon which ſtandeth a maſt with a barrell upon a Warder. For to ſayle in there, you muſt run in cloſe by that land where the Warder with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſtandeth upon, cloſe alongſt by the Warder, but there ſtandeth a hand on the ſtarboard ſide of the havens mouth, which poynteth that there lyeth thwart of it a ſuncken rock under water, there you muſt edge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what off from the ſhoare. Being within there, you may run to the eaſtwards againe into ſea, and come out in the Sound of Sand-voordt.</p>
                     <p>About a league to the eaſtwards of Trom-ſound lyeth the haven of Oxeford,<note place="margin">Oxeford.</note> which is a great broad, and large Sound, lying in firſt without betwixt the rock, north. Without in the comming into the weſtwards of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens mouth, lyeth a long rock, which you muſt leave on the larboard ſide, and ſomewhat paſt that long rock lyeth a ſuncken rock, which you muſt leave on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide and run in ſtill north unto the weſt poynt of the land, thwart where of lyeth a ſuncken rock which you muſt avoyd, when that you come then within the weſt poynt, you muſt ſayle in northweſt and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt and by north, and anchor on the north ſide of the haven, there it is wide and broad, with many bights, where you may anchor every where in twenty and five and twenty fathom.</p>
                     <p>About halfe a league to the eaſtwards of Maerdow ſtandeth a little white Church upon the ſea ſide, to the eaſtwards of it goeth in the Trom-ſound,<note place="margin">Trom-ſound.</note> being a faire Sound. Without in the comming in, ſtand on the eaſt or northſide two Warders upon a high hill, you muſt ſayle in by them, and thwart of them you may alſo anchor, and from thence you may ſayle in further behind the Iſland Trom, and the land of Maerdow, untill you come into the Sound of Maerdow.</p>
                     <p>When the Drommels are northweſt and northweſt and by north from you,<note place="margin">Marks of Maerdow</note> then you are right thwart of Maerdow. If you run in ſo out of the ſea, right with the Drommels, you ſhall fall right with Maerdow, that is a certain mark to know whether you be thwart of Maer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or to the eaſtwards or the weſtwards of it, but when you are cloſe before the land, or before the havens mouth, you cannot ſee the Drommels, becauſe they are then hidden of the cliffeland. To anchor under the Iſland there is the ſhoaleſt water, but with a northweſt or northnorthweſt winde, it is not ſo good to come from thence as out of the haven, but with an eaſterly winde it is better to ſet ſail from thence and to get into ſea.</p>

                     <p>A little about this poynt of Bommel-head, on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſide lyeth a Haven, called Bommelhaven, there lyeth a rock before the mouth of it, and alſo a ſuncken rocke betwixt that rock and the north poynt of that Haven: He that will go in there, muſt go into the ſouthwards of the rock, in betwixt the ſouth poynt &amp; the foreſaid rock, leaving the rock on the ſtarboard ſide of him. So ſoone as men are within the Haven, they muſt let fall their anchor, within it is broade and wide, and men lye there landlockt for all winds.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the Bommell lyeth Munſterhaven<note place="margin">Munſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven.</note> in the land of Bommell-head, on the weſt ſide of the Lieth, even about the poynt.

                     <p>To the northwards of Stade the Iſland lyeth with many Iſlands northeaſt to the broadſound nine leagues. About halfe wayes lyeth a little Iſland or rock, called Swynoe<note place="margin">Swynoe.</note> (that is Hogges-Iſland) a league from land without the other Iſlands of Flowach. When you are cloſe by the north poynt of Stade, and go on northeaſt you run through within that little Iſland Swynoe, but with a northeaſt and by north courſe about a ſea-board of it.</p>
                     <p>He that is bound to Roemſdall, or into the Sounds of Sudmer, muſt runne into the Broad-ſound,<note place="margin">Broad-ſound.</note> which goeth in at the ends of the Iſlands of Flowach eaſt and eaſt &amp; by ſouth, the outermoſt of theſe Iſlands is called Haſſen. When you come to the end of thoſe foreſayd Iſlands, you ſhall ſee eaſt from you about two leagues, a great high ſhort Iſland, called Goedeu,<note place="margin">Goedeu.</note> or of ſome God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſche-ſaed, and a little to the ſouthwards of it, ſomewhat further in a great black rocke, of faſhlon like a hay-cock, or almoſt like a ſuger-loafe, it is called by the ſaylers the Cookes-broad: ſayle in right with it, but bring not that foreſayd rock to or under that Iſland, but keep it clear off without it: for els you ſhould ſurely ſayle upon the foreſayd ſuncken rockes, which lye under water at the north ſide of the broad-ſound.</p>
                     <p>From the Iſland Goedeu or Godſche-ſand runneth off alſo a little riffe, to the ſouthwards, or towards the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt from it.

                     <p>He that commeth from the northwards may ſayle by weſt alongſt by theſe rocks to Goedeu, and leave the a foreſayd ſuncken rocks (lying on the north ſide of the Broade ſound) on the ſtarboard ſide of him, and runne in about by the poynt of Goedue, as hath been beforeſayd.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo run into the northwards of Goedeu, to wit in betwixt Goedeu and Geske, and anchor within Geske, or under Walderoe, but it is not wel to be done, but for them which are there verie well acquainted.</p>
                     <p>There lye manie Rocks, ſome above, &amp; ſome under water, whereof men muſt take heede. In at the Broade ſounde is the beſt and ſureſt.</p>
                     <p>For to runne from Walderoe to Roemſdale, goe on to the northwards, alongſt by the great Iſlands Luycko, it is in that farewaye, 10, 20, 14, 16, and 18 fathom deepe but even paſt Luycko runneth a ſtone riffe thwart over the farewaye, on againſt the poynt of the maine land, you muſt thereabouts edge off from the Iſland on the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, &amp; run indifferent cloſe alongſt by that pointe of the maine land on the ſtarboard ſide, &amp; then you runne over the deepeſt of that Stoneriffe, to witt, in 3 fathom or thereabouts, as ſoone as you ſhall be over it, it is againe verie deepe of 10, 20 and preſently an hundred and two hundred fathom. Runne on ſtill by the land on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, and verie cloſe alongſt by it, and leave all the Iſlands that lye on the larboard ſide, &amp; ſo you ſhall come unto the River of Roemſdale.</p>
                     <p>Towards the ſoutheaſt from the foreſayd Iſland Goedeu or Godſche-ſand goeth a great deepe river into the land, to Sickule, Honighpale, and other lading places more.</p>

                     <p>For to ſaile in there, keepe theſe two foreſaid hills one in the other, and ſayle in right with them eaſt, and eaſt &amp; by north, or (when as you come within the Vogel) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more eaſterly, ſo that you have the foreſaid Hills out a head a little on the larboarde ſide, untill that you come by the main land, and then eaſtnortheaſt alongſt by the ſhoare, (if you be bounde to Dronten) unto the Iſland Edou or Edoe.</p>
                     <p>About a league within the Vogel lye two rockes, the weſtermoſt is high and ſomewhat round, the other is low and alſo round, and lyeth to the eaſtwardes from the firſt, towards the land, you ſhall runne with the a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd courſe of eaſt &amp; e. &amp; by north off from the Vogel, about a ſhot of a caſt-peece alongſt to the ſouthwardes of the 2 rockes. About half wayes betwixt them and the Vogell, (but neareſt the 2 rocks) lye two ſuncken rocks,<note place="margin">Two ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rocks.</note> theſe you leave with the ſame courſe alſo on the larboard ſide, you may ſee the ſea alwayes breake upon them, except in very ſmooth Water.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo ſail through betwixt theſe two foreſayd Rocks and the Mewholmes, to wit, alongſt to the northwardes of the rocks, untill you come into the Liet, leaving theſe 2 rocks on the larboard ſide, and the Mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holms on the ſtarboard ſide.</p>
                     <p>Alongſt to the northwardes of the Mewholmes and thoſe two foreſaid rocks lyeth alſo a channell where men may ſayle through into the Liet, then you muſt leave theſe 2 rockes to the ſouthwardes on the ſtarboard ſide, &amp; ſome other rocks to the northwards of them on the larboard ſide, and ſo come alſo into the Liet.</p>
                     <p>About three quarters of a league within theſe two foreſayd Rocks, lyeth a great ſuncken rock, right in the middeſt of the farewaye, which breaketh allwayes, and at low water is uncovered, about which you may ſayl on both ſides. From this ſuncken rock to Swegge ſound, the courſe is eaſt, and eaſt and by north a league, but the Voghel or black Oxe &amp; Sweggeſound are diſtant about three leagues.</p>
                     <p>Sweggeſound<note place="margin">Swegge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</note> is a litle Haven behind three great rocks, with a little Iſland of an Engliſh mile long on the eaſt ſide of it, when you ſayle alongſt by it, being but a little off from the ſhoare, you cannot diſcerne this Iſland from the maine land, but it ſeemeth to be all whole land, he that is not there verie well acquainted, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that to be an Iſland, before that he come cloſe to it, for to runne in behind it. You may ſayle into Swegge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound either to the eaſtwards of that Iſland, or to the weſtwards of it, according as the winde will ſerve. To the weſtwards of Sweggeſound or the three foreſayd rocks, at the weſt end of the end of the foreſayde Iſland lye a great multitude of rocks &amp; foul grounds.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle into the weſtern channel, you muſt leave them all on the ſtarboard ſide, and runne in betwixt them and the three foreſayd rockes: when you come to the and of theſe three Rocks, you muſt luffe up to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards about by them towards the northeaſt or north, &amp; anchor there in ſeven or eight fathom, there you ſhall lye landlockt for all winds, but with a ſtorm out of the weſt the growne ſea can come in rowling there through. You may alſo ſayle in further behind the rocks, untill you come in behinde the foreſayd Iſland, in a little narrow Bay, there men doe lye in 2 fathom and a halfe, or three fathom, and alſo ſheltred for all windes. In this Haven of Sweggeſound the ſhips commonly doe lye there to tarrie for the winde. He that is bound to the weſtwards, may runne out to the ſouthwards of the three foreſayd rocks, &amp; he that is bound to the eaſtwardes, may ſaile out to the northwardes, through betwixt the Land and the Iſland, but that channell is verie narrow &amp; not above 2 fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>A halfe league to the eaſtwards of Sweggeſound lyeth the haven of Bremſnes,<note place="margin">Bremſnes.</note> a little quarter of a league within it on the ſtarboard ſide ſtandeth a little church, with ſome houſes, which you ſhall eſpie behinde a point, when as you are come ſomewhat within, there dwelleth the Governour of Normer Leen. Men were wont to come to anchor there to paye cuſtome, but now the Kings Cuſtomer dwelleth over againſt it in little Foſſen, ſo that now at this preſent, men may eyther goe there, or to little Foſſen for to paye their cuſtome, according as occaſion doth ſerve.</p>
                     <p>For to anchor before Bremſnes, you muſt looke out for two beackons, which ſtand by the church upon the water ſide, thwart of the innermoſt is the beſt Roade, &amp; alſo the beſt grounde, let your anchor fall there, in twenty, fifteen, eight or tenne fathom, that is neare by the ſhoare, for there it is verie ſteep riſing ground, and make you faſt with a hawſer to the beakons, there you ſhall lie landlockt for all winds, you may not anchor any where thereabouts, then in the foreſayd place, by reaſon of the great depth, &amp; verie ſteepe grounds.</p>
                     <p>Little Foſſen or Foſſound is a narrowe haven,<note place="margin">Little Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</note> lying to the northwardes, over againſt Bremſnes, betwixt two lands. In theſe two places lye the ſhips commonly to tarrie for the winde, they that are bound to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before Bremſnes, &amp; they that are bound to the weſtwardes in Little Foſſen. Men may alſo ſayle from Foſſen to the eaſtwardes, through betwixt the foreſayde land, &amp; come into Stanwixfioerd againe in roome into the Lieth of Dronten, but it is a verie narrow channell, and not wel to be done for them which are not there verie wel acquainted.</p>
                     <p>Weſtnorthweſt, from the haven of Bremſnes goeth a channell through the rockes called Fleſſound,<note place="margin">Fleſſound</note> after three round Rocks,<note place="margin">Three Fleſſen.</note> called three Fleſſe which lye in a rowe without the eaſt ſide of this channell, and thereby is very eaſy to be knowne. A little within the three Fleſſes, lyeth a great black flat rock, when you are by or in the Havens-mouth of Bremſnes, it lyeth weſtnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, or ſomewhat more northerly from you. For to run out from thence at that channell, ſail right with the aforeſaid black rocks, and runne to the ſouthwards of it cloſe alongſt by it, leaving it and the Fleſſes on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, (to the norhwards of this flat rock &amp; the Fleſſe it is all ful of rocks, ſome above and ſome under water) you ſhall then leave on the larboard ſide of you two other round rocks, which you ſhall ſee lye about a ſhot of a caſt peece eaſtnortheaſt, or northe. &amp; by eaſt one from the other. When you are come without the Fleſſes, you ſhall be without all the rocks, but ſomewhat to the weſtwards of them lyeth a great row of rocks, lying weſtnorthweſt a good wayes into ſea, you may runne weſtnorthweſt alongſt by them unto the end: when you are come without the Fleſſes you may ſet your cours ſomwhat more northerly, for to get ſea room betimes. In this foreſayd channell there is no danger, that can hurt you, but you may ſee it. In the offing you may know this foreſayd channell, by the foreſaid three Fleſſes.</p>
                     <p>The markes for to finde Fleſſound, comming in out of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170755:75"/> the ſea, are two high Hils, the one called Freekol,<note place="margin">Freekol.</note> lying upon an Iſland, towardes the ſoutheaſt, not farre from Bremſnes, the other called Northhorne,<note place="margin">North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne.</note> lying farr with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the land. Freekol is a hill with two hommocks where of the ſouthermoſt is the ſmalleſt &amp; loweſt. Northhorne is a hill much higher, with a ſharp toppe, &amp; lye alwayes white, covered with ſnowe. When this hill &amp; the foreſayd ſouthermoſt Hommock of Freekol ſtand one in the other (then they are ſoutheaſt &amp; by ſouth from you) and if that you ſaile in right with then, you ſhall without fail fall right open before Fleſſound. It is a channel of a ſhoare inlet, and very commodious, as alſo Gryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound for them which comming from Dronten, Edou, or any other place in the Lieth, and before night cannot ſaile to the channels of the black Oxe or Voghel, for to runne through them into ſea.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a league to the eaſtwardes of Bremſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes lyeth Stangwyxfioird, a large broad ſound, at the eaſt poynt lyeth a great many rocks, within lyeth a Haven, called Hamerſound,<note place="margin">Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</note> you may not come in there but with a Pilot except you be there extraordinary well acquainted.</p>
                     <p>A quarter of a league within that foreſayd point, on the north ſide of Stangwyxfioird, lye two lade-places, Iorian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wach &amp; Lynwach,<note place="margin">Iorian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wach.

                     <p>Towards the ſoutheaſt from Iorianwach, men may ſayle farre within the land, into divers ſounds, Stang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyxfioird, Schaelwicxfioird, Northfioird, Walsfioird, Wenningfioird, and other more. Upon the land of Iorian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wach lyeth the mountaine of Toeſter, in 2 hilles, to the eaſtwardes of it upon the next land lyeth the mountaine of Stadebuye, alſo in 2 hills, as Toeſter. Theſe hills of Toeſter and Stadebuy, when you come from the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes alongſt the Lieth, lye right behinde one the other, and ſeeme then to be no more then one hill, but being thwart of them in the Liet, or at ſea, each ſheweth in 2, which is together foure very high hills, and are commonly called together without difference Toeſter Poeſter.<note place="margin">Toeſter Poeſter.</note>
                     </p>

Sayling in there you muſt leave Fiſholme and the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Iſland on the larboard ſide, &amp; a rockie Iſland, called the flat Iſland, with manie Rocks on the ſtarboard ſide. The Yellow Iſland<note place="margin">The Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Iſland</note> is not wel to be diſcerned from the main land, for thoſe which are not there well acquainted, the end of the Northfioird runneth there about behinde it, &amp; maketh it an Iſland the Norwaybarkes runne much thereabout behind it. To the ſouthwardes of the flatte Iſland lyeth a Rock or little Iſland,<note place="margin">Flatholm.</note> called Flathome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both is good anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom, landlockt for all winds.</p>
                     <p>Through this Sounde men doe runne into Eurſound,<note place="margin">Eurſound.</note> a lade place lying in the Northfioird, there ſtandeth a little church on the weſt ſide of the flatte Iſland. Betwixt the little Iſland is alſo a good haven, where men may lye in three, foure and five fathom, it is not broade but cleane. To the eaſtwards of this Yellow Iſland lyeth the high land of Dromſnes.<note place="margin">Dromſnes</note> From thence eaſtwardes, further up into the Liet, towardes Dronten or Agenes, it is moſt all whole land, and not ſo broken, as to the weſtwards of it.</p>
                     <p>Thwart of the rocks of Hammer-ſound (lying on the eaſt ſide of Stangwyxfioird) lyeth a faire channell called Gryp-ſound, one of the beſt channells for to come in out of the ſea into the Liet, it is about a quarter of a league broade, and goeth in cloſe to the eaſtwardes of the Iſland Grype.</p>
                     <p>Grype<note place="margin">Gryp.</note> is a little rounde Iſland lying from the Voghell northeaſt and by eaſt diſtant about five leagues, upon it dwell manie Fiſhernen, which goe from thence to ſea, to fiſh upon divers bancks, of fortie, fiftie, ſeventie, eightie, and hundred fathom, foure, five, ſixe, ſeven, eight and ſome tenne leagues without the land, which they knowe to finde by markes on the ſhoare. On the north ſide of Grype there lye but two or three rocks cloſe to the ſhoare, ſome ſaye that thereabout is anchor ground in twelve fathom. On the ſouth or weſt ſide, it is full of Rocks, but they lye moſt above water. About halfe wayes betwixt Grype and the three Fleſſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what without all the other Rocks, lyeth a ſuncken rock a little under water, he that runneth alongſt without theſe rocks, muſt be mindfull thereof.</p>
                     <p>For to goe into Grypeſound comming in out of the Sea,<note place="margin">Gryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</note> you muſt bring the high Mountain of Toeſter Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter eaſtſoutheaſt from you, and ſayle in right with it, and ſo you ſhall not ſayle to runne in ſight of the Iſland Gryp, which is eaſy to knowe from the other rocks, by the great manie Fiſhermens houſes, which ſtand upon it, and upon no other Iſland nor Rocks thereabouts, leave that Iſland on the ſtarboard ſide, and goe in firſt eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoutheaſt right with Toeſter, being paſt the Iſland Gryp, bring Toeſter two poynts on your larboard bowe, and goe ſo in ſoutheaſt, you ſhall come into the Liet betwixt Hammerſound and Toeſter. From thence to the little Iſland Edou<note place="margin">Edou.</note> are about four leagues. About three leagues to the weſtwardes of it, or a league to the eaſtwards of Grypſound in the Lieth, lyeth alſo a ſuncken rock, almoſt even with the water, and almoſt amidſt the farewaye, neareſt the north ſide, you may alwayes ſee the ſea breake upon it, leave it on the larboard ſide, and runne to the ſouthwards of it, there it is broadeſt, you may for a neede run alſo to the northwards of it through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it &amp; the other rocks, but it is there narrow.</p>

Not farre from the weſt end, upon the ſouth ſide of Edou, ſtandeth a little white Church, thwart of it, or a little to the eaſtwards of it, men may anchor in eight, nine, and tenne fathom. The ſhoare is ſteep riſing ground: If men doe come neare it in foure fathom, they ſhall be preſently faſt, but the grounde is ſoft. When as men come from the weſtwards, and will anchor there, they muſt (comming neare the weſt end of the Iſland) continually feele with the leade for the anchor ground, and ſo ſoone as they feele it, let fall their anchor, thwart of the aforeſayd little white Church, or a little to the eaſtwardes of it, ſo that the little Church come to ſtand over the houſes. When as they let fall their anchor in 10 fathom, and wending up towards the land, verie out the cable then the ſhippe ſhall come to lye there in ſixe fathome, the Liet is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts aboute a halfe league broade.</p>
                     <p>Upon the eaſt end of Edou is alſo a little haven called Kurow,<note place="margin">Kurou.</note> and it is ſo little that there can lye no more then two or three ſhips, there lyeth a little black rock not farre from the ſhoare, men doe runne in betwixt that little rock and the Iſland, &amp; anchor betwixt them both, there men lye landlockt for all winds, but the ground there is not cleane.</p>

A little within the poynt, on the ſouth ſide ſtandeth a Countriemans houſe, before which you may anchor in five, ſixe or ſeven fathom, cleane riſing ground, which you may come neare by your leade. This haven lyeth about a league more to the eaſtwards, then Ramſfioird, on the ſouth ſide of the Liet, fitt for to come to anchor in, for thoſe which can ſayl no further by day. To the weſtwards of this foreſaid haven Schaerſwycke alongſt the land of Schipnes, lye manie Rocks by the ſhoare, ſome above &amp; ſome under water, therefore you muſt ſomewhat ſhunne the ſouthſhoare thereabouts, but the north ſhoare alongſt by Hitteren is verie cleane.

                     <p>By Agenes there runneth out alwayes a great ſtrong current to the weſtwardes, &amp; by reaſon the lands from thence to the ſouthwardes on both ſides are very high, and the winde (being ſoutherly) falleth there betwixt then both, alwayes ſtrong to the northwards, men can not (in ſayling up) get any thing there with turning to windewards, but in ſailing off they may get much by the current with turning to windewards.</p>
                     <p>A little about the point of Agenes on the ſtarboard ſide, is a great Bay called Salva,<note place="margin">Salva.</note> wherein is good anchor ground, &amp; good lying, but with northerly winds it is verie hard to come out there for thoſe that are bound out, or to the weſtwards.</p>
                     <p>From Agenes to the poynt of Rooberg, the Liet lyeth ſouthſoutheaſt about three leagues. About halfe wayes or ſomewhat more on the weſt ſide lies another bay, called Lenſwycke, where men may have roade.</p>

                     <p>BY two wayes men may ſaile into the river of London, from the ſouthwards alongſt by the north Forland, and from the northwards alongſt by the Naes. If you will ſayle in there from the ſouthwards, then you muſt firſt ſhun the North Forland, it is there ſhoale a good wayes from the ſhoare, bring the north Forland alſo not more ſoutherly from you then ſouthweſt, that you do not run on againſt the north-grounds,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170755:79"/> which lye farre to ſeawards. Comming by the land, run alongſt by it, but come not too neere it, that you looſe ſight of the ſpyre of the ſteeple of Margat behind the land, for then you ſhould come too neere it; but if you keepe ſo far from the ſhoare, that you can ſee the foreſayd ſteeple above the high land, or keep it even in your ſight, then you cannot take hurt of the ſouth grounds. Comming thwart of Margat, then you are paſt the foreſaid ſhoals or ſouth grounds. Run then bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the ſhoare, and within two cables lengths alongſt by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which lye farre to the ſouthwards towards the land. Sayle on ſo weſt all alongſt by the ſhoare, untill that the Reculvers (which are two ſteeples upon one Church) come one in the other, and then you ſhall run in ſight of the firſt buye upon the Laſts, which lieth upon the foreſaid markes of the Reculvers,<note place="margin">Reculvers</note> being by it you can alſo ſee the other buy which lyeth like as the firſt alſo on the north ſide, and over againſt it on the ſouth ſide ſtandeth a beakon, there you muſt ſaile through betwixt them both, leaving the buye on the ſtarboard ſide, and the beakon over againſt it on the larboard ſide. From thence you may with little ſhippes, or ſhippes of little draught, but not with ſhips of great draught, at high water run over the Swallow on weſtnorthweſt towards Sheppy, for it is there ſhoale water, with ſhips of great draught you muſt runne through the Fiſhers deep towards Black-tayle. You may alſo runne from Margat with ſmall ſhippes alongſt by the ſhoare upon the lead at high water even unto the Sheppy, but in ſayling, alongſt there you muſt caſt your tides well, for the flood falleth very ſtrong into the Swallow, and the ebbe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary very ſtrong out.</p>
                     <p>When you come by Sheppy,<note place="margin">Sheppy.</note> runne within two cables lengths alongſt by it, for to avoid the taile of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,<note place="margin">The Spag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</note> untill that you be paſt Quinsbrough, edge then off from the ſouth ſhoare for to avoyd the Noere,<note place="margin">The Nore</note> which is a ſande that ſhooteth off from the ſouth poynt of the River a good wayes to the eaſtwards, upon the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end where of ſtandeth allwayes a beakon, whereby you may know it. Run alongſt to the northwards of it, leaving it on the larboard ſide, and alongſt in the middle of the channell into the ſea-reach for to avoid the grounds which lye off from the north ſhoare, goe in ſo alongſt towardes Graveſend.</p>
                     <p>To ſayle with ſhippes of great draughts alongſt by the north Forland up into the Thames, you muſt (when you are paſt the buyes upon the Laſt) ſayle through the Fiſhers deep,<note place="margin">Fiſhers-deep.</note> toward Black-tayle, which lyeth from the ſecond buye upon the Laſts, unto the firſt buye in the Fiſhers deep, northweſt and northweſt and by weſt, which lyeth upon the north ſide of the ſand, which men doe call the Spanjard, thoſe two buyes lye a great wayes one from the other.</p>
                     <p>Sayling from the buye upon the Laſts it is a great wayes all ſhoale water, ſo that you muſt runne over there with high water, but comming neare the buye upon the Spanjard, it is by little and little deeper water. He that will ſaile over here, muſt reckon his tydes well, the flood falleth there alongſt towards the ſouthweſt almoſt thwart over the deepe and the ebbe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond buye in the Fiſhers Deepe you muſt leave on the ſtarboard ſide, &amp; the buye upon the Spanjaerd on the larboard ſide: being paſt that you come againſt the Blacketayle, to the ſouthwards of the Shoebeakon into the right deepe. The caſt poynt of Sheppy ſhall then lye about ſouth from you. From the Shoe-beakon the courſe is ſouthweſt to the point of Blacktaile there runneth off a hooke which men might (at unawares) ſayl within (comming from the northwards) in five or ſixe fathom, but if you keep from the ſhoar in ſeven fathom, you cannot ſayle within it. From Black-taile to the beakon upon the Noere, the courſe is weſtſouthweſt, leave it on the larboard ſide, as before is ſaid, and runne in alongſt the river, in the middſt of the channell betwixt both lands unto Graveſend.</p>

                     <p>Betwixt Albrough and Dunwich about half wayes betwixt them, lyeth a Wood which is at both ends high, and in the middeſt low with a ſaddle; this you ſhall commonly ſee firſt when you fall with the land there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and is the beſt to be knowne for to know the coaſt by; the land without it, and to the ſouthwards is very low flat chindely land. About two leagues to the ſouthwards of Albrough lyeth Orfordnes,<note place="margin">Orford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> betwixt them both ſtand alſo two woods of trees, which ſhew themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a farre off like caſtles or towers.

With ſea winds you may deſcerne it plainly by the breaking of the ſea upon it; but with lawderly or weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly winds, &amp; faire weather, the ſea breaketh not upon it, hee that runneth thereby to the northwards with an ebb ſhall ſee it commonly ripple very much upon it, like as upon moſt of the Engliſh bancks, &amp; not indeed upon the bankes, but againſt them, for upon the ſhoaleſt or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the bankes is alwayes the ſmootheſt water, like as you finde every where.</p>
                     <p>When as Aelbrough is weſt from you, and the two ſteeples of Orfordnes are one in the other, there you ſhall finde Albrough Knock. Theſe are ſure marks of that ſand.</p>

Comming from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, men ſayle commonly to the weſtwards of it, that is through betwixt the land and Whiting-ſand, towards the Naze.

                     <p>Upon the poynt of the river ſtandeth a houſe, which is a ſheephouſe, before that you come by it, it ſeemeth as if there were no opening, by reaſon that it is al even green land, run in by it, all alongſt by the land, being paſt it, the River doth open it ſelf. Being come within the poynts you muſt run in betwixt two dikes, a league up untill you come before the towne, in the river it is at half floud everie where deep enough. When as that you come a little within the houſes of the towne on the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boardſide, there you muſt let fall your anchor and ſtay untill that the water begin to fall, then you ſhall have floud enough for to drive to the Kay, there you make faſt with one cable, it doth not begin to bee ebbe there, before that water be fallen three foot.</p>
                     <p>An eaſt and weſt Moone maketh in Boſton deepe the higheſt water, but before the towne an eaſt and by ſouth and eaſtſoutheaſt moone.

Thwart of that foreſayd Saltfleet haven, about an Engliſh mile from the ſhoare lyeth a banck or Sandplate, not verie great, which at low water falleth almoſt drye, you muſt runne about without it, &amp; leave it lying towards the land from you, but yet for need you may alſo ſayl through within it.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle into the Humber<note place="margin">For to ſail into the Humber.</note> comming from the northwards, you muſt ſayle alongſt by the ſhoare, and runne about by the n. poynt, but comming by the poynt you muſt keepe ſomewhat off from the ſhoare in 4 or 5 fathom, for to avoyd a little taile, which lyeth off from the poynt, being about it, runne to the little Iſland, which lyeth a little by weſt that foreſayd north poynt.</p>
                     <p>If comming from the ſouthwards you deſire to ſayle to the Humber, then bring the Pawle Steeple (which is a high ſharpe ſteeple ſtanding on the North ſide of the Humber) a little by ſouth the North poynt of the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or over that foreſayd little Iſland, and ſayle ſo right in with it, untill that you come by that little Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come by it, leave it on the ſtarboard ſide and run in cloſe by it, for to avoyd a great Sand called the Bul, which lyeth off from the South ſhoare almoſt unto that little Iſland.

You may not come neerer the Bull then in ſixe fathome. Before Grimſby you may anchor in three or foure fathome at lowe water, it floweth there at leaſt three fathom up &amp; down, a weſtſouthweſt &amp; eaſtnortheaſt Moone maketh before the Humber the higheſt water. Within the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Iſland at the north poynt of the Humber, you may anchor in three or foure fathom: There lye commonly Ships that are bound out, and tarrie for the Wind.</p>
                     <p>From Grimſby in alongſt to Hull, the courſe is weſt northweſt to the end of the Banck or ballaſt Plate, which you muſt leave lying on the north ſide. On the ſouth ſide lyeth alſo a little plate, there ſtandeth commonly a Beakon upon it, that you muſt leave on the Larboard ſide, &amp; run along to the Northwards of it, being paſt it, you may run alongſt by the South ſhoare in 3 fathom. The fareway there is foure, five, and ſixe, and thwart of the foreſayd Beakon eight and tenne fathom. When you come to the end of the Banke, you muſt edge up to the Weſtwards about by the poynt on the South ſide, but there runneth off a Flat which you muſt avoid. Being a little about that poynt you ſhall ſee the Towne of Hull, lye before you, there you may anchor before it in ſixe, ſeven, or eight fathom: An eaſt and weſt Moon maketh full ſea before Hull. He that will anchor upon the ballaſt plate, let him bring the flat ſteeple which ſtandeth a little to the northwards or the eaſtwards of Hull to the high point of Pawl, and keepe them ſo ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding untill that he come to the plate, there it is beſt for to anchor upon it.</p>

                     <p>On both ſides, as well on the north ſide, as the ſouth ſide of the Tees ſtand 2 little white houſes for fire beacons: If you come from the northwardes and get ſight off them, then bring firſt the 2 ſouthermoſt one in the other, which ſhall then ſtand from you ſouth and by eaſt, ſayle right in with them, untill that the other 2 which ſtande on the north ſide of the Teeſe, come alſo one in the other, then leave them on the ſouth ſide, and ſayle in right with them that ſtand on the north ſide, and ſo you ſhall runne in amidſt the channell, there is upon the barre, or ſhoaleſt, at low water no more then five foote, but it floweth there with a common tyde, at leaſt 2 fathom up and downe. A ſouthweſt moone maketh there full ſea. If when you come from the ſouthwardes, you will ſayle into the Teeſe, then bring the innermoſt of the 2 firebeakons (which ſtande on the north ſide) at leaſt a handſpikes length, or the length off a capſtane barre, to the northwardes of the other, and runne ſo weſtwardes towards them, untill that the two firebea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons on the ſouth ſide are one in the other, then ſaile in right with them, as hath beene ſaide, untill that the 2 firebeakons on the north ſide come one in the other: when you have them one the other, runne in right with them, untill that you come by the north ſhoare, &amp; then cloſe alongſt by it.</p>
                     <p>When as that you come ſo farre in paſt the firſt fire beakon, to wete, that you may ſee Hartlepoole betwixt the 2 firebeakons, there you may anchor in three, 4, or five fathom, or when Hartlepoole commeth betwixt the foreſaide firebeakons, then go ſouthſouthweſt, untill that you come by the ſouth ſhoare there it is alſo good anchoring. Further it is pilots water unto Stockton, for there within, the deepes doe ſhifte oftentimes, and that in ſhorte time, 3, 4, or 5 times in a ſummer.</p>
                     <p>He that will ſayle in there with northerly windes, and a floud, muſt reckon well his tydes, for the floude falleth ſtrong to the ſouthwardes over the groundes, and ſhould thereby bee lightlie carried behind the bank to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes off the buye, which lyeth upon the poynte of the banck.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this foreſaid channell there runneth yet another channell through the grounds, which lye off from the north poynt of the Tees.<note place="margin">For to ſail in to the newe-channell.</note> For to ſayle in there, you muſt take marke of the two high lands within the land, to the ſouthwardes of the Tees, bring them within a handſpikes length one to the other, or bring the Paps to the weſt ſide of Harlenope, then ſhall alſo a foreſayde two high lands come within a handſpikes length neare one to the other ſayle in right with them, and ſo you ſhall runne right into that new channell, alongſt through that a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde ſand, and come againſt the buye (upon the ſandes, on the ſouth ſide off the Deepe) againe in the right fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. When that you get again deeper water, or have the two fire-beakons on the north ſide one in the other, then go in towards them, and further as hath been before ſaid.</p>
                     <p>About ſeven leagues to the northwardes of the Tees lyeth the river off Sonderland, a little to the northwardes off the Paps, which are very good markes for to know the land by there abouts. When the Paps are ſouthſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from you, and that you are about an Engliſh mile from the land, then you are right before the river of Sonderland, the ground is there abouts indifferent cleane, but ſomewhat ſtonie, you may anchor there in 4 or 5, &amp; 6 fathom. On both ſides, as well on the north poynte, as the ſouth poynte of the River it is ſtonie. On the north poynte ſtandeth a beakon in the water, there you muſt runne in, within a little ſhippes length alongſt by it, being paſt that you ſhall gett deeper water, to with, a fathom &amp; a halfe, &amp; 2 fathom at low water, but upon the barre remaineth no more then three foote. With a common ſpring &amp; high water there is about 2 fathom &amp; a half, or a little more.</p>
                     <p>After this aforeſayd firſt depth of a fathom and a half or two fathom, you ſhall meet againe with a ſtonie floore, about three ſhips lenghts broad, upon it is at high water about 11 or 12 foote deep, according as the tydes ſhall runne: being over there, it is again deeper. A little paſt that is a narrow place, where a long ſhippe ſhall ſcarce be able to wend, within it, it is wide enough, and very where good anchor ground.</p>
                     <p>From the Tees to Tinmouth the courſe is northnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt 8 or 9 leagues. Two leagues to the ſouthwards of Tinmouth lyeth the poynt of Sonderland,<note place="margin">Sonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> but cloſe to the ſouthwards of Tinmouth goeth in the River of New-caſtle. From the poynt of Tinmouth ſhooteth off a led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of rocks, you muſt ſayle in by it, leaving it on the ſtarboard ſide. The markes for to ſayle into this River are two firetowers or firebeakons, which ſtand upon the north ſhoare, bring them one in the other, or the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt (that is the higheſt) a little to the northwards of the outermoſt or loweſt, &amp; ſayle ſo right in, alongſt by the aforeſayd ledge of rocks on the north ſide, and ſo you ſhall have upon the ſhoaleſt two fathom at halfe floud, a ſouthweſt moone maketh there full ſea. The ſouth ſhoare is flatte you may lead it in there with the ſounding pole, for ſhips, that goe not deepe, in ten foote at halfe floude. When you come within, runne all alongſt by the north ſhoare, untill paſt the little towne Sheels, edge then over to the other ſhoare, untill you come through the crooked reach, there the river lieth up againe a little to the n. wards, &amp; then to the ſouthwards to Hawkes-bill, &amp; about by it to the towne New-caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Seven or 8 leagues to the northwards of Tinmouth lyeth the Cocke Iſland, betwixt them both about half wayes lyeth a River called Bly,<note place="margin">Bly.</note> where the French men doe much ſayle to fetch coale. From the north poynt of this river runneth off a ledge of rocks a great ſhot of a caſt-peece; about ſoutheaſt into the ſea, but the ſouth ſide, &amp; the coaſt to the ſouthwards of it, is very cleane and ſand-ſtrand. Upon the ſouth poynt ſtand two bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons: If you will ſayle in there, bring them one in the other, and ſayle right in with them, and then you can take no hurt of the foreſayd ledge or riffe of the north poynt. When that you come by or thwart of the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of the 2 foreſayd beakons, you ſhall ſee there by it another ſmaller beakon, that ſtandeth upon a little ledge off rocks, that ſhooteth off from the ſouth poynt, leave that on the larboard ſide, and runne in alongſt cloſe about northwards of it. The foreſayd ledge of Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes on the north ſide remaineth at high water (a good wayes from the land, and alſo at a ſpring-tyde) above water, within it is a bight, there it is good lying for a

In the mouth of the River it is with an ordinary tyde and high water about two fathom deep, or ſomewhat more, and it floweth there two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom up and downe, ſo that at low water it falleth allmoſt altogether dry.</p>
                     <p>The Cocket Iſland,<note place="margin">Cocket Iſland.</note> is a very little Iſland, &amp; not high it lyeth about a halfe league from the land, you may come to anchor in it for an eaſt, ſouth, &amp; ſoutheaſt wind, but the winde comming to the northwards of the eaſt, maketh there a bad roade, for you muſt lye betwixt the Iſland and the maine land where you have no ſhelter for a north winde. On the ſouth ſide of the Iſland the ground is foul, &amp; a little to the ſouthwards of the Iſland, runneth off a foule ledge of rocks from the ſhoare, untill thwart or paſt the Iſland. He that commeth from the ſouthwards, muſt keepe the Coaſt of Bambrough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Iſland, or els he ſhould not faile to ſaile upon the poynt of that foreſayd ledge.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt that ledge and the Iſland it is alſo very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo that a man ſtanding at low water marke upon the rockes of this ledge, ſhould allmoſt be able to caſt with a ſtone unto the Iſland. For to ſayle in there, take heed unto theſe marcks here after deſcribed: there ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a houſe upon the ſea ſide, which is a Salt kettel, and alſo a Caſtle ſomewhat further in within the land, which doth ſhew it ſelf high enough, bring them one in the other, &amp; then they ſhall ſtand ſomewhat more northerly then weſt from you, and runne ſo right in with them, and ſo you ſhall runne in right amidſt the channell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, being come within, edge up behinde the Iſland, &amp; anchor there in five or ſix fathom.</p>
                     <p>About this Iſland there run alſo manie more divers little Rivers in to the land, but they fall moſt drie at low water.</p>

For to avoyd them when you will ſayle through betwixt the Staples &amp; the Holy Iſland, whether you come from the Southwards or the Northwards, then bring the Steeple of Teuſtenbrough over the Caſtle of Bambrough and keepe them ſo ſtanding, and then you ſhall run through betwixt them both, this channell lyeth ſo through northeaſt &amp; ſouthweſt. From the outermoſt end of the Staples to S. Abbens head,<note place="margin">S. Abbens head.</note> the courſe is north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt 8 or 9 leagues.</p>
                     <p>From Holy Iſland to S. Abbens head it is northnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt 7 or 8 leagues.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards of S. Abbens-head men doe runne in unto Lieth and to Edenbrough in Scotland.</p>
                     <p>S. Abbens head &amp; the Iſland the Bas lye eaſt and weſt 4 leagues aſſunder. The Iſland May &amp; S. Abbens head northweſt &amp; ſoutheaſt 4 great leagues. May &amp; Bas lye one from the other ſouthweſt &amp; by weſt and northeaſt &amp; by eaſt three leagues &amp; a halfe. The Bas<note place="margin">The Bas.</note> is a high round Rock cleane round about, which you may ſayle alongſt by on both ſides. Betwixt the rock and the ſouth ſhoare it is ten and twelve fathom deepe, but the common faire way is alongſt to the northwards of it. Betweene S. Abbens head and the Bas it is moſt part a cleane Coaſt, but without anchor ground. The Iſland May<note place="margin">Iſland May.</note> is greater then the Bas, &amp; alſo cleane round about, except on the eaſt ſide, there it is foule.</p>
                     <p>From S. Abbens head alongſt to the northweſt of the Bas, the courſe is weſt and by north and weſt northweſt foure leagues, and from by north the Bas to the Iſland Inchkieth<note place="margin">Inchkieth.</note> weſt and weſt and by north about five leagues. Betweene the Bas and Inchkieth by the ſ. ſhoare lye many Rockes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little Iſlands and foule grounds, where at divers places is road, but are not to be uſed, but by them which are there verie well acquainted. Inchkieth and Iſland May lye ſ. w. &amp; by w. &amp; n. e. &amp; by e. 7 great leagues aſunder. Inchkieth is ſomewhat a long ſmall Iſland, a league to the northwards of it lyeth an out poynt on the north coaſt called Kingorneſſe,<note place="margin">Kingor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> before it and about it lie ſome little Rocks under water but a little to the eaſtwards of the eaſtwards of the point is good anchor ground &amp; road for weſterly winds. Betweene that point and the Iſland May, or the point of Fifsnes on the north ſhoare lye divers little Havens, where of ſome of them doe alſo yeeld out coales, but are little or nothing uſed by the Hollanders. On both ſides of Inchkieth is good ground, &amp; good lying as well for weſterly as eaſterly winds.</p>
                     <p>From Inchkieth to Lieth it is ſoutheaſt a league. Before Lieth<note place="margin">Lieth.</note> about halfe an Engliſh mile from the ſhoare lyeth a Rock upon which ſtandeth a Maſt (with a croſſe or ſome other thing of wood upon the top of it) for a beakon. At high water the Sea floweth over it, &amp; at low water it falleth dry. With a ſpring tyde at low water men may go on foot to it. From the eaſt ſide of that Rock lyeth off a Riffe almoſt unto Inchkieth. You may alſo run through to the ſouthwards of Inckieth betwixt that foreſayd Riffe &amp; the ſouth ſhoare, but is not to be done, but by them which are there exceeding well acquainted: There is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether full of Rockes &amp; foule grounds. When as you ſayle in to the northwards of Inchkieth you muſt leave the foreſayd Maſt on the larboard ſide, and run about to the northwards of it, &amp; then towards the ſouth ſhoare, and anchor about halfe an Engliſh Mile by weſt Lieth, and alſo halfe an Engliſh Mile from the ſhoare, in 6, 7, or 8 fathom. Lieth the Haven Edenbrough are tyde Havens which fall dry at low water.</p>
                     <p>From Lieth to Queenes Ferrie<note place="margin">Queenes Ferrie.</note> there lye on both ſides many Rockes, ſome above and ſome under water. In the Narrow before Queenes Ferrie lyeth a little Iſland called Inchgarve which you muſt runne alongſt to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of, on the ſouth ſide it is with a Stone bancke (where men may goe over at low water) faſt to the mayne Land, alongſt to the northwards of it, it is cleane and deepe. Within that little Iſland lye Caryn and other places more where men doe lade Coales.</p>
                     <p>Under the eaſt ſide of the poynt to the northwardes of Queenes Ferrie is good road in 2, 3, or 4 fathom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you lye farre from the ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>A league north from the Iſland May lyeth the poynt of Fifsnes,<note place="margin">Fifsnes.</note> lying from S. Abbens head northweſt and by north 4 great leagues. From thence to Dondee it is north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northweſt five leagues.

Johns,<note place="margin">S. Iohns.</note> which you may goe up to at high water.</p>
                     <p>Betweene the poynt of Fifsnes and Dondee lyeth alſo the Baye of S. Andrewes,<note place="margin">S. Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</note> there is all over good anchor ground. Foure great leagues north &amp; by e. from the poynt of Fifsnes, &amp; northeaſt from S.

                     <p>Seven leagues to the northwards of Dondee lyeth Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſe,<note place="margin">Monroſſe</note> a good Haven, Firſt you muſt ſayle in there amidſt the channell, and edge up to the northwards &amp; anchor before the Towne.</p>
                     <p>Over againſt Monroſſe lye three Hommocks which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170755:88"/> ſhoote out from the other land, bring the middlemoſt and the houſes upon the ſtrand together, then ſhall you find the middle of the fareway, on both ſides of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens mouth lyeth a blind cliffe.</p>

                     <p>From Monroſſe to Stone Baye<note place="margin">Stone-Bay.</note> or De Torre, the courſe is northeaſt &amp; by North foure leagues. This is a deepe bay &amp; a good Have<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thoſe that are bound to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, where men may lye Land-lockt with many Ships.</p>
                     <p>Three leagues to the northwards of it lyeth Aberdyn:<note place="margin">Aberdyn.</note> In this Havens mouth it is three fathom deep. The weſt poynt is ſomwhat foule, therefore you muſt run in by the eaſt land, untill you come within the Haven, and anchor before the Towne in foure or five Fathom. Up to the northwardes is a great Bay, but is ſhoale on both ſides. There goeth through a little Creeke towards old Aberdyn, which is an old ruinous Towne.</p>
                     <p>From Aberdyn to Boeckenes<note place="margin">Boecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> the courſe is northnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt twelve or thirteene leagues.

To the northwards of Boeckenes lyeth a Bay as a Haven called Spy<note place="margin">Spy.</note> or Spilaert and right before the ſhoare lyeth a ſand called Rutten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh which you muſt take greate care thereof as you come from the northwards. From thence the land lyeth in weſt &amp; weſt ſouthweſt unto the Haven of Roſſe or Luvernes.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards of Roſſe lyeth an out poynt called Cape Tarbate,<note place="margin">C.

It is from thence to Catenes 14 leagues northeaſt &amp; by north Catenes lyeth from Boeckenes northweſt &amp; northweſt and by north 20, 21, or 22 leagues. From Boeckenes unto the outermoſt Orckanes it is north and by weſt and northnorthweſt two and thirtie or three and thirtie leagues.</p>
                     <p>The Orkeneys are one and thirtie Iſlands in number, firſt Wayets or Elhoy, which lyeth next to Scotland, five leagues about the poynt. About northnortheaſt off from the poynt of Catenes lye two little Iſlands Pits &amp; Pichlandſcare there you may run through to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards betwixt Elhoey and Scotland.</p>
                     <p>To the northwardes of them lieth an Iſland called Heynda, with an other Iſland called Platta, to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes off Platta lyeth Mayland or Ponoma. On the north ſide of this greate Iſland are all the havens where the ſhips come to.</p>

                     <p>On the weſt ſide of Fairhill is at ſome places foule ground, but upon the ſoutheaſt ſide is good anchor ground, there you may anchor every where but there ſtretcheth a riffe on the eaſt ſide of the ſhoare off ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt two leagues in to ſea.</p>

On the ſame ſouthweſt ſide, over againſt the Iſland Fulo lyeth a Sand-bay, where men may anchor, but on the eaſt ſide of this Bay, it is ſomewhat foule. From that northweſt or weſt poynt off to the north end, the land of Hitland lyeth northeaſt by north, &amp; ſouthweſt and by ſouth, twenty or one and twenty leagues.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the northwards of the foreſaid weſt poynt lyeth the Haven of S. Magnus,<note place="margin">S.

                        <note place="margin">Names of the Iſlands of Fero.</note>The greateſt and chiefeſt Iſlands of Fero are 12, in number, as Suydro, Sando, Moggenes, Wage, Stromo, Oſtro, Calſo, Cuno, Bordo, Wydro, Swyno and Fulo.</p>
                     <p>The little Iſlands of Fero are ten, as Littledymen, Stoerdymen, Schuyvo, Dalſfles, Heſden, Trallo Colſter, Moggenſholme, the Monck, and the Biſhop. Beſides theſe there are yet ſome rocks and little Iſlands, to ſeven or eight in number.</p>

                     <p>Upon the weſt ſide of the Iſland Suydro are no havens for to ſave any ſhippes in, but it is altogether high ſteepe land. On the North ſide are maine havens, where men may ſayle into and ſave ſhips, as Sommerſound or Heſt, Hofwycke. Vrobie, Quaelbie or Rane, all broad ſounds or havens, a countrie man or Pilot can bring you in there every where to your deſire.</p>

In the middeſt of the Sound of Waghe, goeth up a haven to the eaſtwards into the great Iſland Stromo, there in you may anchor in ten or twelve fathom, but the Sound is at leaſt twenty fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>Moggenes &amp; the northeaſt end Fero lie eaſtnortheaſt or a little more northerlye, &amp; weſtſouthweſt about fifteene leagues aſſunder.

                     <p>Theſe Iſlands of Fero lye in a triangle, it is from the ſoutheaſt end of Suydro to Fulo, or the north end of Fero northnortheaſt and ſouthſouthweſt 21 leagues a ſunder.</p>
                     <p>From Scotland weſtwards and to the northwards of Ireland, lye many Iſlands, whereof we ſhall here deſcribe ſome, with ſo much perfection, as thereof is yet knowne.</p>
                     <p>The names of the principall Iſlands<note place="margin">Names of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</note> lying there are theſe: Areu, Ila, Jona, Mulla, Bragedull, Hun, Lewis S.

                     <p>The Iſlands of Lewis lye from Rona ſouthweſt diſtant ſixteen or ſeventeen leagues, and from the north end of Lewis to S. Kilda, it is ſouthweſt and by weſt, 16 leagues.</p>
                     <p>On the eaſt ſide of S. Kilda is a good roade for a weſt and northweſt winde. This Iſland lyeth by the other little Iſland where of the two are not very great, upon that which lyeth to the weſtwards, you may ſee ſome houſes ſtand, and theſe two little Iſlands lye tenne leag. to the weſtwards of the great Iſland of Lewis. Upon the coaſt of Lewis lye alſo two rowes of great rocks, like as if they where little Iſlands, lying one from the other ſouth &amp; north ſomewhat eaſterly about 7 or 8 leagues.</p>

                     <p>The Iſland of Lewis is devided into many parts, the which men may ſayle through at many and divers places. Lewis with the Iſlands belonging to it lye ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouthweſt and ſouth and by weſt about 29 leagues.</p>
                     <p>But on the eaſt ſide goeth a broade Sound through of five or ſix leagues. Men ſayl in cloſe by the Iſland of Lewis, about ſouthſouthweſt untill paſt the Iſland Cheut.</p>

                     <p>It is indeede no Iſland, but very neare: it is faſt to the maine land, with ſuch a very ſmall neck, that the Ruſſes, which come from Kilduyn, or the River of Kool, and are bound to the River Pitſing, doe goe alongſt within this land, &amp; hawle their boates over that ſmall neck, for not to goe about a ſeaboard.</p>

This is a right playne coaſt; without poynts or bayes, all alongſt by Laus to Tiepena, but the ſouth poynt of Laus lyeth out a little, upon which ſtand two Warders, to the northwards of that poynt is the haven of Laus, a fayre ſand-bay, there is very eaſy lying for ſoutherly or eaſterly winds, but not for northerly winds, the winds betweene the northermoſt and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt doe blowe there open in, and make therein a very great hollow ſea, men lye there in twelve, tenne and eight fathom, according as they runne farre in, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſhoaler, but all cleane riſing ſand-ground.</p>
                     <p>From Laus a little towards Kegor lyeth a little Iſland, behinde which is good anchoring for eaſterly winds, in cleane ſand-ground, but it is ſomewhat narrow.</p>
                     <p>From Laus to Tiepena,<note place="margin">Tiepena.</note> it is a great halfe league, at the poynt lye ſome little rockes, but you cannot ſee them, before you be cloſe to them. Tiepena is a fayre haven, when you come from the northwards, you muſt runne ſo farre to the ſouthwards, alongſt by the ſhoare, untill that you ſee open into it, and ſayle in amidſt the channell. When as you come from the ſouthwards, the haven openeth it ſelfe, being come in, you muſt edge up to the northwards, and anchor there, there you lye land-lockt for all winds, there are no dangers which may hurt you, but it is over all cleare and cleane ſandy ground.</p>
                     <p>A little about the poynt, to the ſouthwards of Tiepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which is on the ſouthweſt ſide of the Fiſhers Iſland is another faire haven, where men may goe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, called Kowens.<note place="margin">Kowens.</note>

                     <p>You may alſo anchor under the maine land, betwixt the narrow, and the Roade of Kilduyn, at the place where the anchor ſtandeth marked, in the Carde. At the eaſt end of Kilduyn lyeth alſo a Fiſhers village, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kammen, at a high poynt, which is called the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice poynt.</p>
                     <p>From the Iſland Kilduyn to the poynt Tiribiry, the courſe is ſoutheaſt and by eaſt about five leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them is a great bay. In this bay, a great league from Kilduyn lyeth a high Iſland called Blieſna Olinie,<note place="margin">Blieſna Olinie.</note> which is the next or the neareſt Olinie, behinde it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mayne land, neareſt the ſouth end of the Iſland is a good road, where three or foure ſhips may lye very well.</p>
                     <p>The lyeth a round hill, or high Hommock upon the maine land, which ſheweth out above all the other hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mockes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and is very eaſy to be knowne, upon which ſtandeth a high croſſe of two croſſes one above the other, to the northwards off it lyeth a flat poynt, thwart of it lye ſome rocks alongſt the ſhoare, which at high water are covered.</p>
                     <p>At the ſouth end of the Iſland Olinie, a little from land, lyeth a rock almoſt even with the water, but you may alwayes ſee it well by the breaking of the water.</p>
                     <p>To the Northwards of the Iſland about an Engliſh myle, lyeth a rock not farre from land, and alſo to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from it a ſuncken rocke, which you cannot goe over at low water.</p>
                     <p>Hee that will (comming from the northwards) goe to anchor behinde Olinie, muſt runne a good wayes to the eaſtwards of this foreſayd rocke alongſt to the northwards of the Iſland, for to avoid the foreſaid rocke. Being come behinde the Iſland, you ſhall eſpy the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd round hommock with the croſſe, you muſt not runne paſt the croſſe, but leave it on the larboard ſide, and ſayle incloſe by it for to avoyd the foreſayd rockes, which lye off from the flat north poynt, the poynt with the croſſe is very cleane and ſo ſteepe, that you might lye with a ſhip on againſt the ſhoare without any hurt.</p>
                     <p>He that will come into this Road from the ſouthwards, let him run alongſt by the coaſte, which is very cleane, untill paſt the foreſayd poynt with the croſſe, and edge up cloſe about by it, as is beforeſayd.</p>
                     <p>Men doe anchor within the poynt in ſeven, ſixe, five, foure and three fathom, deepe or ſhoale as they will, there goeth no grown ſea at all.</p>
                     <p>About halfe wayes betwixt the Iſland Olinie and Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biry<note place="margin">Tiribiry.</note> is another haven or great Bay, where men may lye landlockt for all winds.</p>
                     <p>Tiribiry is a great River and off-water, where is a great Salmon fiſhing, there men may goe in with great ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and anchor every where within it where they will in good ſandy-ground, it lyeth in moſt ſouth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more weſterly, the eaſtermoſt poynt lyeth out more to ſeawards than the other, ſo that it maketh a bay, where men ride under for a northweſt winde.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the ſouthwards of Tiribiry lyeth Waronia, which is a great ſand-bay or haven, with at the mouth is narrow, but within it is a broad Sound, there is alſo an off-water, where is alſo much Salmon caught.</p>
                     <p>Within this bay it is every where good anchoring, ſhoale water and cleane ground.</p>
                     <p>Before the mouth of this haven lye three little Iſlands, behinde them is alſo good road.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues or two leagues &amp; a halfe to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Waronia lyeth a Gabriele,<note place="margin">Gabriele.</note> a tyde haven, which falleth dry within, ſo that men may goe over there dry at low water, it floweth there twelve foot up and downe, a ſouthſouthweſt moone maketh high water on this coaſt.</p>
                     <p>In the mouth of this haven lye three Iſlands, two on the north ſide (which are the loweſt) and one on the ſouth ſide, that is the higheſt, you muſt runne neereſt the ſouthermoſt when as you will ſayle in there: being come within the Iſlands, you muſt edge up to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards behinde the two northermoſt Iſlands, and anchor there on the north ſide of the haven, there it is ſeven and eight fathom deepe cleane ground.</p>
                     <p>About a league to the ſouthwards of it lyeth Salenſi Daelna,<note place="margin">Daelna Silenſi.</note> that is to ſay, the farther Silenſi; but betwixt them both a little to the northwards of Silenſi, lyeth yet a great indraught which lyeth in at leaſt two leagues into the land, and is about ſo wyde as the River Tye before
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170755:105"/> Amſterdam, there may lye a great multitude of ſhippes, it is there broade and large enough, and all over good anchor ground.</p>
                     <p>A little to the northwards of this in-draught lieth a little Iſland, or rock, ſomewhat high, about which you may ſayle within, to witt, through betwixt theſe rockes and the land, but may make no road under them.</p>
                     <p>Salenſi Daelna<note place="margin">Daelna Silenſi.</note> is a great broad bay, before it lye three Iſlands, which are to ſee to gray of colour, as the mayne land.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards of theſe Iſlands upon the poynt off the bay ſtandeth 3 great Warders, and a little to the ſouthwards of the Iſlands, on the mayne land lyeth a ſteepe hill, by which markes this bay is very eaſy to be knowne.</p>
                     <p>If you will ſayle into this bay comming from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alongſt the ſhoare by the foreſayd great in-draught, a little to the northwards of this baye, you muſt looke out for theſe foreſayd great Warders, leave them on the ſtarbord ſide, &amp; ſayle in cloſe by them, through betwixt that poynt and the Iſlands, firſt weſtſouthweſt, ſomewhat within, and then more ſoutherly, untill behind the Iſlands, and anchor there in five, ſix, or ſeven fathom: you may alſo ſayle further to the ſouthwards into the baye, ſo deepe as you will, there it is all over cleane.</p>
                     <p>When you come before the channell, it ſeemeth to bee very narrow, but it is broad enough.</p>
                     <p>To the ſouthwards of theſe Iſlands is alſo a channell which is very narrow, but yet for need you may ſayle out there. The ſouthermoſt Iſland, that is, whereupon the Fiſhermen dwel, is faſt to the northermoſt with a ſhoale, whereupon is at high water 10 or 11 foot water, but at low water you cannot goe over it.</p>
                     <p>Two little leagues to the ſouthwards of Salenſi lyeth the Iſland Daelna Olinie,<note place="margin">Daelna Olinie.</note> that is to ſay, the Furtheſt Olinie, it is an Iſland almoſt of Faſhion like Blieſna Olinie, at the north end high, at the ſouth end lower, and upon the end very ſteepe, it hath in the middeſt, (but ſome what neerer the ſouth end then the north end) a low valley, where at high water the ſea doth almoſt run alongſt over it.</p>
                     <p>Behinde this Iſland, not under the Iſland, but under the mayne land, are good roades.</p>
                     <p>For to come in from the northwards behind this Iſland, it is a broad, large, and very deepe Channell, without any dangers, but if you will ſayle in behinde it (from the ſouthwards) then you muſt runne in cloſe by the Iſland, for to avoyde a foule and ſtony riffe, which lyeth off from the maine land, halfe wayes to the Iſland, and ſo ſhoale that it falleth dry with the ſpring tydes at low water.</p>
                     <p>About halfe wayes the Iſland, neareſt the ſouth end, is a point, lying out from the mayne land, twoards the Iſland, to the northwards of it men doe anchor in 6, 7, or 8 fathom.</p>
                     <p>When you come in from the northwards, you may (ſo ſoone as you come within the points) luſſe up towards cloſe about the point of the main land into a bay, &amp; anchor there in eight, ſix, five or foure fathom, according as you ſayle far in, there it is very eaſy lying. In theſe roades under the mayne land, it is all cleane &amp; flat riſing ground, but under the Iſland it is deepe, and the ground riſing very ſteep, &amp; therefore it is not good ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt this Iſland Daelna Olinie, &amp; Silenſi, lye 3 little black Iſlands, where is very eaſy road under them in 8, 7, and 6, fathom.</p>
                     <p>From Daelna Olinie to Rinde<note place="margin">Rinde.</note> are five leagues. Rinde is a very faire Haven, before it lye foure little Iſlands, where men may goe to anchor behinde them, behinde theſe Iſlands this Haven hath two bayes, upon the point betwixt them both ſtandeth a great Croſſe, the ſouther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt baye is farre the greateſt, into it commeth alſo a river or off water, where men doe catch Salmon. The middlemoſt Iſland (which is the northermoſt ſave one) is the greateſt and higheſt upon which ſtandeth a great Warder, the northermoſt is ſomewhat long and ſmall, &amp; ſo low, that at high water the ſea runneth up a good wayes upon it on both ſides, and ſo maketh that Iſland ſmaller.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt that Iſland and the maine land, or the north ſhoare of the Havens mouth lyeth a ſuncken rock, which you muſt leave, in comming in, on the larboard ſide, and runne in cloſe by the main land, this channel is ſo narrow, that you cannot ſayle in it, except you have a large wind, at low water there remaineth no more then 9 or 13 foot water.</p>
                     <p>To the ſouthwards of that great Iſland, lyeth another Iſland that is indifferent high, and the ſouthermoſt of them all, betwixt that and the point of the maine land, lyeth in the ſouther channell, which is broad and deep enough, but when you ſeyle in there, you muſt run neareſt the land, for to avoid a ſuncken rock which lyeth at the foreſaid poynt of the maine land.</p>
                     <p>Theſe channells both from the ſouthwards and from the northwards lye in both alongſt the ſhoares, when as that you come then within the Iſlands you may anchor there all over where you will, there it is broad and large, and every where cleane &amp; cleare. Men doe anchor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly under the greateſt Iſland thwart of the great Warder, and alſo behinde the norhermoſt Iſland in five, foure or three fathom there it is very eaſy lying but with a ſoutheaſt winde, the ſea commeth a little rowling in, but there can goe no great ſea.</p>
                     <p>Farre within the ſouthermoſt bay, almoſt before the river, lyeth a rock, but above water. Without the greateſt and the ſouthermoſt Iſland, lyeth a little Iſland, or great rock, ſomewhat round, you may ſayle out and in betwixt the ſouthermoſt and the greateſt Iſland, alongſt to the n. wards of that little round Iſland, that is you muſt leave the ſouthermoſt Iſland with the outermoſt little round Iſland both on the ſtarboard ſide, and the greateſt Iſland with the Warder on the larboard ſide, when you ſayle out, this is a very narrow channell, but very cleane and cleare, ſo that there is nothing to bee avoyded, but onely a little ſuncken rock, which lyeth at the north end of the outermoſt little round Iſland, and falleth dry at low water, nevertheleſſe it is not good to uſe it, except it were for need that you could not doe better.</p>
                     <p>He that is bound into this haven, muſt run cloſe alongſt by the ſhoare for to get ſight of the foreſayd Iſlands, for by reaſon that the inner land is high, the Iſlands lye ſo under the land, that men can hardly ſee them, when they bee any thing farr off from the ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>A halfe league to the ſouthwards of Rinde is another great Bay, or haven, before it lye two little high Iſlands upon the northermoſt ſtandeth a great croſſe, you may ſayle in there about on both ſides off theſe little Iſlands, and alſo through betwixt them, and anchor where you will in fifteene, twelve, eight, or five fathom, deep or ſhoale, according as you ſaile farre in lye &amp; there ſheltred for all windes, but when the winde is hard out of the ſea, thwart upon the ſhoare, there will come in ſomewhat a rowling ſea, but there can goe no great ſea that can hurt you. A little to the northwards of this haven lyeth a low long Iſland cloſe to the ſhoare, whereby you may alſo know this coaſt, you may ſayle through betwixt this foreſayd Iſland &amp; the maine land without any danger.</p>
                     <p>From this haven to the Seven Iſlands are foure great leagues. A little to the northwards of the end of the ſeven Iſlands, lyeth a faire great ſand-bay, where is alſo good anchoring for ſoutherly and ſoutheaſt windes, but not for eaſterly winds, with a northeaſt or ſea wind, it is bad lying there for there is no ſhelter for them, men doe anchor there in twenty, fifteene or twelve fathom, according as they lye far or neare to the ſhoare. The Ruffes call this Bay the Golden Bay,<note place="margin">Golden Bay.</note> becauſe the ſtrand is of red ſand.</p>
                     <p>On all theſe foreſayd coaſts a ſouthweſt &amp; northeaſt

                     <p>The ſeven Iſlands<note place="margin">Seven Iſlands.</note> lye all of them alongſt the ſhoare, the firſt or northermoſt is farre the greateſt of all, a high Iſland. The foure northermoſt follow cloſe one to the other, and lye about an Engliſh mile, or a ſhot of a caſt peece, a little more or leſſe off the land, ſo that men may ſayle there through betwixt. The fifth is a little round Iſland, and lyeth nearer to the land, there you cannot runne through within it, which is faſt to the land with a ſhoale of rocks, whereof ſome lye above, and ſome under water. The two ſouthermoſt lye a good wayes to the ſouthwards of the fifth: betwixt them &amp; the mayne land you may alſe ſayle through, you may alſo runne through in &amp; out betwixt theſe ſame Iſlands every where, except betwixt the ſecond and third off from the northwards betwixt them both it is fowle.</p>

                     <p>Betwixt the northermoſt and the mayne land is a good road (thwart of the ſouth end of the Iſland) under the maine land, there is a faire ſand-bay, with an off-water, where is much Salmon to be caught, but it is not there uſed.</p>
                     <p>A little to the northwards of this Sand-bay lyeth a little Iſland betwixt the great Iſland and the coaſt, men doe anchor to the ſouthwards of that little Iſland, thwart of the ſand-bay in ſeven, ſix, five, or foure fathom, ſo ſhoale as they will, there is a very even ſand-ground, riſing ſo even as if it were planed.</p>
                     <p>Over againſt the foreſayd bay men may make road under the ſouth poynt of the Iſland, thwart of a little bay, there they bring a hawſer on land, and an anchor to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in nine-tenne fathom, there they lye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more out off the tyde then in the bay over againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt this great Iſland and the coaſt is about two third parts of the channell towards the mayne land, flat riſing ground, and the other third part towards the Iſland Deep; the neerer the Iſland the deeper unto 18 and 19 fathom.</p>
                     <p>About halfe wayes betwixt that foreſayd little round Iſland, and the north poynt of the grateſt Iſland, ſtand on the mayne land ſome little Lappiſh houſes, or a little village.</p>

                     <p>Men may anchor at divers places within theſe Iſlands. Betwixt the two ſouthermoſt Iſlands, and the innermoſt Iſland, you may have roade, where you may lye ſheltred for all winds, and ſafe from Ice-drifts out of the ſea. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the innermoſt Iſland you muſt alſo anchor over againſt it ſomewhat further in againſt the ſteepe poynt. At the rivers mouth, on the weſt ſhoare is a bay where you may ſayle in, and anchor ſo neare to the ſhoare as you will, in ſix, five, foure and three fathom ſoft ſticking ground, there you lye ſafe from Ice-drifts. You may alſo anchor on the eaſt ſide, right before the ſteepe poynt, but there you lye not ſafe for ice that commeth out of the river. The tyde here alongſt theſe Iſlands, agreeth neere with the tyde of Swetenoes, it floweth with Spring tydes neare two fathom and a halfe up and downe.</p>
                     <p>Behind the poynt of Swetenoes you may run into the bay, and anchor there for a north, northeaſt and eaſt winde, there is cleane ground.</p>
                     <p>From Swetenoes to Lombaſcho,<note place="margin">Lomba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcho.</note> the coaſt lyeth ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoutheaſt thirteene leagues. Under Lombaſcho men may alſo goe to anchor, but it is not there very good lying, eſpecially with great ſhippes; the ground there is not cleane, and when the wind is out of the Sea, commeth in there rowling very much. The lying of this road ſtandeth drawne out at large in the Card, with the depths ſet downe as it is at high water and neepe tydes: the water falleth and floweth there at leaſt two fathom up and downe, &amp; at Spring-tydes little leſſe then three fathom, or two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom and an halfe.</p>
                     <p>Within the poynt, or in the bight of Lombaſcho you may not anchor, there remaineth not above three foot water, and the ground is ſtony and foule.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards of Lombaſcho lye five Iſlands lying alongſt the coaſt allmoſt halfe wayes to Swetenoes.</p>

                     <p>From the poynt of Orlogenes lyeth off a ſtone-riffe a ſhot off a caſt peece into Sea, which falleth dry a great wayes at low water, whereof men muſt take very good heed.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Iſlands are much lower then the maine land, ſo that they can hardly be ſeene or not at all, except you be by the ſhoare, thwart of them you may come neere the ſhoare in ſeven fathom without danger.</p>
                     <p>Thwart of theſe three Iſlands, and Ponnoy, the mouth off the white ſea is at the narroweſt.</p>
                     <p>About foure leagues thwart off to ſeawards from the three Iſlands in the middeſt of the mouth lyeth a ſhoale, which is very uneven and ſtony, and at ſome places with low water commeth dry above water, it lyeth ſouth and north, firſt north alongſt the coaſt, at laſt north and by weſt untill thwart of Lombaſcho, but there alongſt it is deepe enough, fifteen and ſixteen fathom. About ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt from Ponnoy it is at the ſhoaleſt ſeven fathom deep. You may alſo ſaile alongſt to the eaſtwards of this ſhoale into the white Sea, but there it is ſhoale water, uneven &amp; very ſhoale. The right fareway is alongſt to the weſtwards of it, and five and twenty fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>Ponnoy is a River where at low water remaineth no more then ten foot water, it floweth there with a ſpring-tyde three fathom up and downe, and with an ordinary tyde 15 foot.</p>
                     <p>From the three Iſlands to the Iſland Souſnowits, which men doe call the croſſe Iſland, the courſe is ſouthweſt &amp; by ſouth, or as ſome doe hold ſouthweſt ten leagues, or from Ponnoy nine leagues. All alongſt this coaſt men may anchor every where in eight or nine fathom, and with contrary winds ſtop the tydes, there goe ſtrong tydes eſpecially in the ſpring of the yeare withan Ebb.</p>
                     <p>Between the three Iſlands and the croſſe Iſland lyeth a poynt, upon which ſtand alſo three croſſes, one by the other, which men doe miſtake oftentimes for the croſſe Iſland, but it is much ſmaller to ſee to. When you doe get ſight of that poynt, there ſheweth by it, as if there lay a ſhippe before the land with the topmaſt-ſtricke. The right croſſe Iſland hath upon the north end two Croſſes, and upon the South end three, by all theſe markes they are eaſy to bee knowne one from the other.</p>
                     <p>Behind the Croſſe Iſland you may have road in 6 or 7 fathom, you may ſayl in behind it, as well from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as from the ſouthwards, it is there cleane and cleare every where, men doe anchor, when as the great croſſe doth ſtand from them e.n.e. there is the right road.</p>
                     <p>Southeaſt and by ſouth from the three Iſlands, and Ponnoy on the Ruſſe ſide, there goeth in the Meſeens golfe, into which commeth a great River, where men may go up to Kilda, and Kolmogro, and alſo another, upon which the town Slowoda lyeth.</p>
                     <p>Southeaſt from Ponnoy lyeth a little Iſland in the mouth of the Meſeens golf, where you may have road under for weſterly and ſouthweſt winds.</p>
                     <p>The ſouth poynt of this golf is a low ſand-ſtrand, all grown with trees, there you may alſo anchor alongſt by the ſhoare, but cloſe by the land; if you lye ſomewhat of from the ſhoare in 9 fathom, there the ground is foule, from thence alongſt the ſhoare to the Blew point, it is al faire ſtrand ground.</p>
                     <p>From the Croſſe Iſland, to the blew or Gray point, the courſe is ſouthweſt twenty leagues. In this fareway in the mouth of the White-ſea,<note place="margin">Current in the mouth of the white ſea.</note> there goe ſometimes very ſtrong currents, eſpecially in the ſpring, through the terrible great freſhuts, of the melting of the ſnow, which falleth from both ſides into the White-ſea, and runneth through this ſtrait into the ſea, with graet whirling &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible riplings: It happeneth ſometimes that the current runneth there ſo terrible ſtrong, to the w. wards into the ſea, that with a reaſonable gale &amp; full ſayls, men can doe no more but ſtem the tide, where of men muſt be mindfull.</p>
                     <p>Under the Gray poynt<note place="margin">Gray-poynt.</note> men may anchor on the ſouth ſide in tenne, eight, or ſeven fathom, there it is good lying for eaſterly windes, a northeaſt winde commeth from the poynt the ground is there reaſonable good, but not the cleaneſt.</p>
                     <p>From the Gray poynt eaſtwards to the Meſeens Golf the coaſt is all faire ſand-ſtrand, with ſome bancks of 2 fathom and an halfe, and three fathom alongſt the ſhoare, not farre without the land, where ſometimes the current falleth over with great riplings.</p>
                     <p>From the blew poynt to the river of Arch-Angell, the courſe is ſouth and by weſt fourteen leagues. When as you ſayle ſo towards the rivers, you ſhall then firſt eſpy the land a good wayes to the weſtwards of S.

Therefore when ye ſee both the land and the Yce, ye muſt ſaile along by the Yce, which ſhall lead you into the corner of the Straits.</p>
                     <p>The corner of the Strait lieth juſt upon ſixtie grades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north the Line, for the Yce ſtretches himſelf according as the wall lieth: and when ye come beſouth the Yce, about nine and fiftie grades and five and twentie or thirtie minutes, ſometimes ſomewhat ſouthly, ſometimes ſomewhat north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo ſhall the Yce lie north north-weſtward from you, alike as the wall the Straitward in lieth, to the hight of threeſcore three grades, and then lieth the wall right north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till over the threeſcore ſix grades and thirtie minutes; and then ye come into the narrow of the Strait, which is about thirtie miles broad; till ye come to the hight of one and ſeventie grades and thirtie minutes: and then ye come in an open roome Sea lying north-weſt, running round northward towards the eaſt, and from thence ſouthward again to the above mentioned narrowneſſe.</p>
                     <p>This Sea runs northward to the hight of ſeventie and nine grades, where it is cloſed by faſt land; with a great many bayes and rivers moſt part full of Yce, which becauſe of the ebbing and falling of waters is driven through the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſſe of the Strait into the north-Sea, and from thence unto the coaſts of Terra Nova,<note place="margin">Terra No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</note> into the great-bay of S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Laurence, after and on the weſt-ſide of Terra Nova.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of this land on both ſides of the Strait, are heathens and wilde men: and therefore are not to be truſted though they give never ſo many tokens of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Whatſoever they handle or change with you, they lay it on the oares wherewith they row their Canoe, they truſt no bodie, and therefore are not to be truſted, for as aforeſaid they lay their wares on their oares and ſo delivers it to you. When ye are reſolved to goe on land, ye muſt be well armed, and eſpecially with muſquets, for as for ſwords or Sabels they care not, becauſe they can reach you with their arrowes, or with their Slinges ere ye can come near them; but if ye happen to kill one or two of them with muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet bullots, the reſt ſhould in haſte flee from you to their mountains where they have their abode.</p>

                     <p>In the Spring of the year on the eaſt-ſide of this Iſland is not ſo much yce as on the north-ſide. For the ſea on the north ſide, (which is never above ten miles navigable) is in the Spring commonly alwayes frozen.</p>
                     <p>The winde blowes there commonly out of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, both harder and oftner as out of any other place.</p>
                     <p>In the South-bay, a ſouth-ſouth-eaſt and a north-north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt moone (according to the common compas) makes a full Sea. The floud flowes there from the ſouth towards the north, and ebbes contrarily.</p>
                     <p>The firſt day of Auguſt (at the north-end of the aforeſaid Iſland) did the Sun riſe in the northeaſt with the one half of his bodie under and the other half above the Horizon: and the laſt day of July was he wholy under.</p>
                     <p>On the North-end of this Iſland is a very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commonly called the Bears-mountain,<note place="margin">The Bears-mountain.</note> the which, if ye behold it from the north, ſeemeth to be cloven, but if ye behold it from the eaſt or weſt-ſide, it ſeemeth round, falling as it were ſmoothly downward, except at the northeaſt corner, where it ſtretcheth it ſelf outward.</p>
                     <p>The North-corner is hillie and rough, it ſeemes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what low becauſe of the high ground that lyeth about it: from thence the matter of half a mile ſouthward the coaſt is hillie, ſtay and ſhallow, ſo far from the wall as a little canon can carry, is it about 20 fathoms deep: a little more ſouthward is there a ſmall foot-ſtrand of ſtonie ground, ſo that upon ſome places ye could make ſhift to bring your chaloup or boat, and this ſtretches it ſelf the mater of a mile in length ſouthward.</p>
                     <p>In or upon this ſtrand there are three Yce-hills<note place="margin">The three Yce-hils.</note> high and ſtay, thoſe are congealed of the ſnowwater which fals in the ſommertime from the top of the mountain, two of them lies near to the North-end of the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>From thence further ſouthward is the wall for the matter of a quarter of a mile, (or ſcarce ſo much) hilly and ſtay, as it is at the north-end, and from thence is there another ſhore about half a mile in length, thereon likewiſe can ye bring your boat.</p>
                     <p>From thence come we to the Southeaſt-corner of the Beats-mountain, which is likewiſe hilly and ſtay as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid wall, ſo that it is impoſſible to come up on it, at ſome places higher other ſome lower, oneven, it is commonly 25 or 30 fathoms high from the water, and within goeth it in ſome place ſomewhat ſtay upward to the Bears-mountain.</p>
                     <p>At this corner lie ſome little rocks ſeparated from the land, whereon are a great many of ſeverall ſorts of fowls, ye can row to and about theſe rocks with your boat: A little about this corner there lie likewiſe ſuch rocks without the wall,<note place="margin">Divers rocks.</note> between theſe rocks there is a commodious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with a little Sand-bay,<note place="margin">Sand-bay.</note> where ye can eaſily bring up your boat whileſt ye anker; there ye are freed from the ſea, for it is there commonly calm water, although it ſtorms without. Ye cannot perceive that there is a haven there till ye be within the rocks; from theſe rocks weſtward about a ſhort mile, is the wall ſtay and rockie as before, yet not ſo high, all alongs the coaſt is there many ſharp rocks ſtanding as it were out of the wall: from the land off, as well by the ſhore as by the ſtay wall, the matter of a muſquet-ſhot, or thereabout ye have water ſome ſixtie fathoms deep.</p>
                     <p>When ye have paſſed this ſtay ſhore, then ye come to a flat ground of black ſand, which is about a mile in length, about a little canon-ſhot from the wall, ye have ſix fathoms water with black ſand on the ground, this ſtrand is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the great Hout-bay,<note place="margin">The great Hout-bay.</note> or Wood-bay, becauſe there is ſometimes found much old broken wood: hereby landwards in lies divers flat hills of black<note place="margin">The black hill.</note> earth and few ſtones, here is the land at his ſmaleſt, for being on the top of this hill, and ſhips ſailing on every ſide of it, ye could make them hear your voice both at once.</p>
                     <p>Weſtward from the end of this great Hout-bay, where the land lieth ſouth-weſt to the ſouth, is there another rockie wall, alike to the aforeſaid, ſo far as a piece of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non can carry, further have ye another flat, called the ſmall Hout-bay,<note place="margin">The ſmall Hout-bay.</note> with an even shore like to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>A quarter of a mile Seawards in, by the South-end of that ſmall Hout-bay, there lieth a rock, which to look to ſeemeth to be a ship with topſails up:<note place="margin">A rock like a ship vvith top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails.</note> hereabouts is it flat water.</p>
                     <p>Southward from this ſmall Hout-bay, there lie many rocks and hills in the ſea, there is likewiſe a ſtay rockie wall; between this wall and the rocks is a paſſage that runs in ſea ſouth ſouth-eaſt on, called the Bears-gat,<note place="margin">The Bears-gat.</note> where within four fathoms ye have ſtonie-ground. Ships could come in to ly there, but there is no anker-ground.</p>
                     <p>A mile and a half ſouthweſt ſoutherly from the aforeſaid rock that ſeemeth like to be a ſhip, there lieth another rock of that ſame fashion, yet not ſo ſharp above as the other, this lieth but a ſmall canon-ſhot from the land: beſides this there are many other little rocks (whereon are abundance of fowls) ſtanding out in a corner: between this and the Bears-gat is the wall rough and rockie, and ſometimes here and there ſmall foot-ſtrands whereon ye cannot come with your boat: and from thence begins the land to be higher and ſtonier, for from the aforeſaid corner Seawards in it is rockie and ſtonie, and landwards in full of hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; in time of need ye may bring your boat to the foot of the hills: half a mile further there lieth more ſuch rocks, ſtayly deſcending to the water; alongs the shore, ſo far from land as a ſmall piece of canon can carrie, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fiftie or ſixtie fathoms deep.</p>

                     <p>Claes Dirckſon Seyn from Wijck wrote in the year after our redemption 1616. that about eleven or tvvelve miles ſouth ſouth-eaſt from the South-corner of the Iſland, he found 35 or 36 fathoms, vvith black moulie ſand, and ſmall ſtones.</p>
                     <p>John Sybrantſon Pael-man writes, that ſouth-eaſtward from the ſouth-eaſt corner of the Iſland about two miles he found rockie ground, my neighbour had once 60, and I had but 30 fathoms, ſo that it is very uneven there.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a mile northweſtward from the South-corner, there ſtands a rock high above water, with ſundrie other little rocks by him, which are commonly called the ſeven or five rocks,<note place="margin">The ſeven or five rocks.</note> when ye come from the north ye can eaſily paſſe through between them: hard by the land there lieth a Holmken<note place="margin">Holmken.</note> a little above water.</p>
                     <p>From theſe ſeven or five rocks till near under the wall drieth it up from thirtie to five fathoms.</p>
                     <p>From the ſouthwall north northweſt a ſhort mile the land falleth out with a corner, commonly called the Low-ſouth-corner,<note place="margin">The Lovv-ſouth-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> on the ſhore is it low, and there lieth the ſloops that keeps watch.</p>
                     <p>Between the South-corner and this corner there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall infalls, with a low ſhore, commodious for boats to come by, in the infalls is it ſandie ground, ſix or ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep.</p>
                     <p>Between this and the South-corner lye ſome ſmall rocks, ſome above and ſome under water: from thence about two canon-ſhot is the land ſomewhat crooked to an infall, which is commonly called, the Bocht of Guinea.<note place="margin">The Bocht of Guinea.</note>

                     <p>Afore this Bay ye have from nine to fifteen and ſo forth to eighteen fathoms, with black ſandie-ground, a little further off ye have five and twentie, yea thirtie fathoms, with ſhort ſtonie ground; and again ſo far as a ſmall piece of canon can reach ye have fourſcore fathoms, and ſoft ground.</p>
                     <p>Between the Bocht of Guinea and the South-bay the wall is very ſtay, ſtonie, and rockie: when ye ly on fifteen fathoms afore this South-bay, then ye can ſee through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the land and the Fowlie-rock, or Vogel-klip.</p>
                     <p>Some two canon-ſhot from this Fowlie-rock<note place="margin">Fovvlie-rock.</note> into the Bocht there lieth a ſmall rock; and on land there is a Red-hill;<note place="margin">Red-hill.</note> in the aforeſaid Bocht there lieth a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, whereon ye may lay four or five chaloups.</p>
                     <p>The matter of a mile north-eaſtward from the South-bay, ye ſhall finde a little corner, then ye have a gate or entry where ye can row through from the mountains into a Kolk or depth, there ye have ſo much room as to lay ſome twentie chaloups on; and it is very convenient for the waiting on whales: this is called of Sea-men the Hoep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks-Bay.<note place="margin">The Hoep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks-Bay.</note>

                     <p>The matter of a mile north-eaſt northerlie from the aforeſaid Rudſen, there is an outlying corner, commonly called the Walrush-gate,<note place="margin">VValrush-gate.</note> without or rather at the which there lieth the Briellish-ſteepel, between theſe two the land hath a great infall, which is commonly called North-bay, and is the moſt convenient place of all for the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of fish-oile.</p>

In the fore-ſommer the ships lie near on land within the Bay on eight or nine fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>From the Briellish-ſteepel the land lieth eaſtward up, and hath for a mile flat ſtrand, which is very convenient for chaloups to keep watch: the aforeſaid corner of the Walrush-gate is very high and ſtay towards the ſea; at the end of the aforeſaid mile, ye finde nothing but rockie ſtay land without any ſtrand, (and which is worthie to be made mention of) a canon-shot from thence ye have a ſtone, on the fashion of a ſteepel.</p>
                     <p>At the end of this aforeſaid land a little foreby the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there ye finde a little infall, which is called Mary-Mus-bay,<note place="margin">The Mary-Mus-bay.</note> becauſe that Mary Mus from Rotterdam, of happie memorie, was the firſt that ever ſent a ship there to boile oil: there is a very commodious anker-ground; for about a canon-shot from land, ye have five, ſix, or eight fathoms water: and a far way Seawards in ye have ſmooth water, likewiſe ye have a shore fit for all kinde of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities uſeable for boiling of fish.</p>
                     <p>A little landwards in ye have a pool, whereout ye can take fish, yea, ye can bring your boat from shore into that ſame pool.</p>

The corner of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denoes is well enough known; there ſtands 5 great croſſes up for tokens, which when ye come by, ye can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly perceive that the land fails you, on the one ſide ſouth-weſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the White ſea, and on the other ſide ſouth-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>About ten miles eaſterly from Cabo de Candenoes, there lieth an Iſland called Morſonowits,<note place="margin">Morſonovvits.</note> from thence eaſterly there lieth a great Inham landward in, which is a flat undeep water, withall a deceitfull ground. There hath been divers ſhips who have ſaild amiſſe here, thinking that they had been in the mouth of the Whiteſea, therefore it is neceſſarie to learn to diſtinguiſh the land, for the Ruſſiſh coaſt eaſtward Candenoes is very ſandie, and a flat shoar; and the coaſt of Lapland is high, and full of mountains. Into this Inham there runs a river from the land, through the which ye can come in boats to the White ſea.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this Inham about twentie miles eaſt and eaſt ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly from Candenoes, there lieth an Iſland called Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goya,<note place="margin">Colgoya.</note> which is ten miles in length; ye may ſail round about it, but on the ſouth-ſide thereof lieth a craig which comes from the eaſt, that ye muſt shun, becauſe it joyns to the weſt-end of this Iſland. There are a great many geeſe on this Iſland, which in the ſommer time are wholly naked having no kinde of feathers; they lay their egge under their ſtump or taile, and on that fashion breeds forth their young ones: there are ſuch multitudes of thoſe geeſe there, that the Ruſſes comes with their Lodges or boats to land, and takes of them by multitudes, and ſalts them in tuns.</p>
                     <p>From the Candenoes to the Iſland Tuſſara<note place="margin">Tuſſara.</note> the courſe is eaſt ſouth-eaſt 32 miles, and between both lieth this great ham. On the weſt-ſide of Tuſſara lieth the corner of Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genoes.<note place="margin">Svvelge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</note> From Tuſſara to the river of Colcova<note place="margin">Colcova.</note> the courſe is eaſtward five miles, that is a good river, and ſome twelve foot deep, there is no other traffique there but that the Ruſſes comes from Colmogro and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Niclaes with their lodges to change their wares for rough skins.</p>
                     <p>Five miles eaſtward from the river Colcova lieth the river Pitſana,<note place="margin">Pitſana.</note> which is but ſix foot deep, and is not well known, a little weſterly from this lieth a drie bank which ye muſt shun. Olivier Brunel coming from Nova Sembla ſat here on ground.</p>
                     <p>Ten miles eaſtward from Pitſana lieth the river Pitſora,<note place="margin">Pitſora.</note> that runs by the eaſt-corner in, ſouth ſouth-eaſt, and is deep ſix Holland yards: the land there is low and ſandie, on the weſt-corner there ſtands a Pack-houſe whereon ſtands ſome croſſes; when ye come within the river, turn a little weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward up toward the Pack-houſe, and let anker fall on three or four fathoms water, there is a great poole or lake.</p>
                     <p>Ye muſt shun the eaſt ſide of the river, for it is full of ſand and banks. The town of Pitſora lieth 26 Dutch miles land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in: there is abundance of coſtly skins and criſtall.</p>
                     <p>Between Pitſora and Way-gats lieth Oltgijn,<note place="margin">Oltgijn.</note> and without on the land lieth two rocks or little Iſlands, the one called Oranjen, and the other Graef Maurits: there ye may ly at anker on ſix or ſeven fathoms. From the ſouth-ſide there comes a ſandbed off-falling, where ye have but three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. On the eaſt and weſt-ſide of theſe two Iſlands there is a great Inham, flat water; the land lieth there in the round to the corner of Pitſora, all in one Inham: it is from Pitſora to Way-gats north-eaſt eaſterly 24 miles.</p>
                     <p>Way-gats,<note place="margin">VVay-gats.</note> which is likewiſe called the Strait of Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſowen, is a narrow paſſage through which ye can ſail into the Tartariſh ſea. It lieth firſt eaſterly, and then north-eaſt the matter of ſix or ſeven miles, about midway there lieth an Iſland which ye can ſail by on both ſides. A little within the corner on the north-ſide is a brave bay,<note place="margin">Traen-bay.</note> into the which ye can let anker fall ſo deep as ye pleaſe, to wit on five, four or three fathoms, good ſtrong ground; toward the eaſt wall ye have the deepeſt water, and ye ly there ſafe from all windes or Yee-flouds. It hath been aſſayed at two ſeverall times to finde away through this Strait, to ſail be-north Tartarie to come to the rich Kingdomes of Cathy and China, and from thence to Molucquen; but all in vain, becauſe of the great Yee that lieth there the whole year, and never melts, by reaſon of the conſtant cold.</p>
                     <p>From the eaſt-end of the Strait Way-gats to the Inham of Oby,<note place="margin">Oby.</note> the courſe is eaſt ſouth-eaſt and ſouth-eaſt

                     <p>The weſt-coaſt of Nova Sembla<note place="margin">Nova Sembla.</note> lieth from Way-gat northward to Conſtint-zarck, north-weſt about fourtie miles.

                     <p>From Elburgh to Uytſtede are 7 or 8 leagues. Betwixt them both about 3 leagues to the eaſtwards of Elburgh, and 5 leagues to the weſtwards of Uytſtee<note place="margin">Uytſtee.</note> is a poynt, off from which lyeth a ſhoale, come no nearer it then 8 or 9 fathom. Uytſtee lyeth in a bight, and hath a high ſharp ſteeple. If you be bound thither, then bring the ſteeple north from you, and then ſayle in right with it towards the ſtrand; there ſtandeth a red tiled houſe to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the bridge, bring that houſe and the end of the bridge one in the other, and ſayle in ſo, and runne to the weſtwardes of the bridge, anchor there in 3 fathom, or two foot leſſe, there is cleane ſand-ground. When you come from the weſt, and are paſt that foreſayd ſhoale then you may boldly runne alongſt by the ſhoare in 3 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom &amp; an half, without feare.</p>

                     <p>From the point of Goeſſebeer runneth off a great ſhoale farre to ſeawards, and lyeth alongſt the coaſt, unto neare Sandhammer, you may ſound it in ſix, eight, and ten fathom, as you will. When you runne over it in tenne fathom, then lyeth the north-end of Bruntholm about eaſt &amp; by ſouth from you, and the poynt of Sandhammer north. Under the Sand-hammer<note place="margin">Sand-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> is good anchoring for a weſt, weſtſouthweſt, weſtnorthweſt, &amp; northweſt winde, in five or ſixe fathom.

                     <p>The point of Goeſbeer and the north end of Brunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm lye northweſt and by weſt and ſoutheaſt &amp; by eaſt about five leagues aſunder, but Uytſtee and the foreſayd north end off Bruntholm lyeth weſtnorthweſt &amp; eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoutheaſt 9 leagues aſſunder.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle from Falſterborne about to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Bruntholme you muſt go on eaſt, ſo long untill that you have the length of Uytſtee, then forth eaſt and by north, and then you ſhall ſayle yet neer enough to the poynt and ſhoale of Goeſbeer, come no nearer it then ſeven or eight fathom. But to ſayle From Faſterborn to the ſouthwards of Brontholm, the courſe is eaſt and by ſouth ſomewhat ſoutherly two and twenty or three &amp; twenty leagues, &amp; alongſt the ſouth ſide off Brontholme eaſtſoutheaſt.</p>
                     <p>The Iſland Brontholm<note place="margin">Bront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</note> is clean round about, except on the ſoutheaſt poynt, there runneth off a foule riffe, called Brewers rif, which men muſt avoyd. On the northeaſt ſide you may runne alongſt by it upon your lead, without doing amiſſe, in 12 or 13 fathom, &amp; alongſt the ſouthweſt ſide in 8 or 9 fathom.</p>
                     <p>Men may anchor round about Brontholm,<note place="margin">Roade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</note> at divers places, as before Rottum, &amp; to the northwards, before the Caſtle, thwart of Sandwick, Suaux and Nex.</p>
                     <p>Before the Village, betwixt Rottum,<note place="margin">Rottum.</note> &amp; the caſtle that ſtandeth upon the northweſt poynt, is good anchoring for an eaſt or northeaſt winde, in thirteen, fourteen, and fifiteen fathom, but not verie cleane ground.</p>
                     <p>Thwart of the Caſtle it is good lying for an eaſtnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, eaſt, &amp; eaſtſoutheaſt winde in 18 &amp; 20 &amp; alſo 14 &amp; 15 fathom, ſand ground, but nearer the ſhoare the ground is not varie cleane, the nearer to the ſhoare the fouler ground.</p>
                     <p>Under the northweſt poynt before Sandwick<note place="margin">Sandwick</note> there is good anchoring for ſouthweſt windes, and you may come neare unto that poynt. From the northweſt poynt to the other poynt the ſhoare lyeth eaſtſoutheaſt and weſtnorthweſt.</p>
                     <p>On the eaſt ſide is good anchoring before Suaux and Nex: but before Nex it is not verie clean. By Nex<note place="margin">Nex.</note> runneth off a little riffe from the ſhoare, which is ſteepe on both ſides: but if you come no nearer it then in tenne fathom, you can take no hurt of it: to the northwardes of Nex
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170755:126"/> lyeth alſo a great rock. He that will anchor before Nex, let him anchor ſo that the flat ſteeple which ſtandeth above Nex, doe ſtand betwixt the w. &amp; w. &amp; by ſ. from him, and that the north poynt bee north and by weſt, and the ſouth poynt be ſouthſouthweſt from him, there it is two and twenty fathom deep, and cleane ſand-ground. At many other places it is otherwiſe ſtonie &amp; rough ground, with ſouthweſt &amp; weſt winds you have there a weather ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>The Eertholmes lye from the north-end off Brunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm eaſt and by north &amp; weſt &amp; by ſouth three leagues aſunder, and from the ſoutheaſt end ſouth and north five leagues. In the Eertholms is a little Haven, but by reaſon that is not uſed it is unknowne.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt the north poynt of Bruntholm<note place="margin">Shoale by Brunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</note> &amp; the point of Sand-hammer, but neareſt to Bruntholm lyeth a ſhoale of ſix fathom, where ſometimes Fiſhermen doe lye to fiſh it is not verie great, but hard ſtonie ground.</p>
                     <p>From Sandhammer the coaſt lyeth northnortheaſt &amp; north &amp; by eaſt two leagues to Somer-haven, this is a round bay, within it is very good anchor ground. From thence the coaſt lyeth about north 6 leagues unto Ahuys. From the north poynt of Brontholm to Ahuys, the courſe is north ſomewhat weſterly about 13 or 14 leagues. But to Hanno north, and by eaſt 13 or 14 leagues.</p>
                     <p>Ahuys lyeth upon a river, where ſometimes is before the towne 10, or 11, and ſometimes alſo no more then 4 or 5 foot water, according as the water commeth off out of the land, upon it is a great fiſhing, where in the ſommer time are great ſtore of good Els taken. To the eaſtwardes of the mouth of the River runneth off a ſtony flat from the ſhoare, and to the ſouthwards of the river a foule ſtony riffe, right off from the ſhoare alongſt by the foreſayd flat, ſo that there lyeth in a channell betwixt the foreſayd flat, and riffe, which is called the Eaſtergat.</p>
                     <p>Through this foreſaid riffe lyeth in a channell untill into the Eaſtergat, on againſt the ſlatte, which is called the Southergat. If you will ſail into this ſouthergat, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the ſouthwards, then runne to the weſt ſhoare to the ſouthwards of Ahuys, untill you come in 5 or 6 fathom, and then you ſhall ſee upon the north ſhoare, north and by weſt or ſomewhat more weſterly from you, a cape or beacon ſtanding a little from the ſtrand within the land, of faſhion like a mill without wings: Bring this beacon to the weſt ſide of the high Hill, which lyeth ſomewhat further into the Land, to witt, even in the going off the higheſt of the hill, keepe theſe markes ſo ſtanding, and ſail in right with them, untill that Ahuys commeth over that tree, which ſtandeth there at the north end of the wood; or that the white Countrie-church come to the northwards of the little houſes of Ahuys, then goe on northweſt, or bring that foreſayd white-countrie-church in a little valley, a little to the northwards of an old ruined caſtle, where of there ſtandeth yet ſome of the walls upon the north ſide of the River, and ſail ſo on, untill that Ahuys come to ſtand in the middeſt of the River, anchor there in two fathom and an halfe, or three fathom, there is the roade there can goe no ſea. In this ſouthergatt it is two fathom, two fathom and an half, and ſometimes alſo at leaſt 3 fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle into the Eaſtergat,<note place="margin">Eaſtergat Ahuys.</note> comming from the ſouthwards keepe in ſixe or ſeven fathom, and runne ſo to the north ſhoare, and then you runne alongſt without the riffe, that lyeth off by ſouth the rivers mouth from the weſt ſhoare untill that Ahuys doe ſtand right weſt from you, then there commeth a great tree to the wood, that ſtandeth upon the weſt ſhoare, keepe that ſo ſtanding and runne in right with it, untill that foreſayd countrie-church come to that aforeſaid old peece of wall, of the old ruinous caſtle, and then right in, as hath beene before ſaid. Or runne in by the firſt markes, untill within a ſhot of a caſt peece neer to the weſt ſhoare, &amp; then edge up to the north ſhoare, untill that Ahuys come in the middeſt of the River, and anchor there, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Hanno<note place="margin">Hanno.</note> is a high round Iſland, which men may ſayle round about, under it is good road for ſouth and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt windes.</p>
                     <p>Behind Hanno runneth up a little River to Self-brough, but ſerveth onely for ſmall ſhippes or Crayers, which go not deepe.</p>
                     <p>From Ahuys to the Rockes the courſe is eaſt and by ſouth twelve or thirteene leagues, betwixt them both lye divers little townes, as Fleholme and Rottenbuy,<note place="margin">Fleholm Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buy.</note> where men may anchor before, in ſixe, ſeven, and eight fathom good anchor ground: And other Havens more, but little or nothing knowne by Hollanders. Thwart of Rottenbuye lyeth a little Rocke ſomwhat off from the land, called Malqueren, under which men may alſo ride.</p>
                     <p>From the north poynt of Bruntholm to the Rocks the courſe is northeaſt ſomewhat northerly ſixteen leagues, but from the poynt of Sandhammer eaſtnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt ſixteen leagues. If you runne alongſt cloſe by the north poynt of Bruntholm, you ſhall runne with a north waye, alongſt even without the Rocks: But if you runne alongſt cloſe by the poynt of Sandhammer, and will ſaile from thence to the Rockes, you ſhall with a northeaſt &amp; by eaſt waye fall with the Land even within them, or to the Weſtwardes of them.</p>
                     <p>The Rocks<note place="margin">The rocks</note> are ſome little rocks together, which men may ſayle round about, but can have no Roade under them; they lye 3 or 4 leagues diſtant from the maine land, &amp; are ſmaller then the Eartholms.</p>
                     <p>A leagues or two to the northwards of them lyeth the Vrouwen of Greene Iſland, by ſome called the Rough-Iſland, and alſo the Outlyers: It is not ſo brooken in it ſelfe as the Rocks, and alſo much greater, off to ſeawards from it, lye ſome rocks, to the weſtwards of it, it is all full of rocks, ſome above and ſome under water alongſt even faſt to the Land, you may ſaile about within the Greene-Iſland betwixt it and the rockes, but no man can doe it, but he muſt be verie well acquainted there, and then alſo not without great daunger. To the ſ. wards of it you may alſo finde Road at ſome places but you muſt be verie wel acquainted, &amp; alſo not without daunger, by reaſon of the multitude of ſuncken rocks and ſharp grounds. The eaſt ſide of of the Outlyers lye from the rocks northeaſt and by north. The ſouth end of Oeland<note place="margin">Oeland.</note> is a ſharpe point, and lyeth from the rocks eaſt &amp; weſt about ten leagues diſtant. Thwart of it, betwixt the mayne land and the aforeſayd ſouth poynt of Oeland, it is about four lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues broad, betwixt them both goeth in the Calmer-ſound.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle up into the Calmer ſound, then goe on from the rockes, or from the Outlyers northeaſt, and by eaſt and then you runne in betwixt Oeland &amp; the maine land, upon 14 fathom and ſayle then northnortheaſt betwixt them both, a middeſt the channell, both the ſhoares are verie foule: but if you come not nearer them then in 7 fathom, you can take no hurt there.</p>
                     <p>From the Rocks to Calmer are ſixteen leagues: About halfe wayes betwixt them, northweſt from Southerorden the ſouthermoſt poynt of Oeland lyeth the towne of Chriſtianopell,<note place="margin">Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopel.</note> lately built there upon a little Iſland by the Kings Majeſtie of Denmarke, and ſo called after his name. Thwart of it was wont to lye upon the mayne land a little towne called Overſchare,<note place="margin">Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchare.</note> now it is one with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianopel, thwart of it lyeth a ledge of rockes about a great Engliſh mile off from the ſhoare ſoutheaſt into the ſea, come no nearer it then in ten fathom.</p>
                     <p>At Chriſtianopel is a haven on the eaſt ſide, from it lyeth off a riffe towards the eaſtnortheaſt into ſea; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will ſayle in there muſt come in from the northwards for to avoyde this riffe.</p>
                     <p>To the northwardes of Chriſtianopel towardes Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is on both ſides (as well on the ſide of the mayne land, as on the ſide of Oeland) all full of rocks and foule grounds, but you may ſound both the ſhoares: in the middeſt betwixt both in the farewaye, it is tenne and twelve fathom deep, all ſoft claye ground, to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170755:126"/> of Chriſtianopel it is deeper, but to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Calmer it is by little and little ſhoaler.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the northwards of Chriſtianopell lyeth Bercker haven,<note place="margin">Bercker-haven.</note> there men doe lade oaken beams, there within it is good lying, but verie bad for to come in or out, becauſe of the multitude of ſunken rocks, and other foule grounds, which lye before it, about a half league off from the ſhoare to ſeawards.</p>
                     <p>About a league to the northwards of Berckerhaven lyeth Hoſmes ground,<note place="margin">Hoſmes ground.</note> which is a very bad foule ground, lying ſomewhat farther off from the ſhoare to ſea-wards, then the other rocks which lye alongſt the ſhoare, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof you muſt take heede.</p>
                     <p>About a league to the ſouthwards of Calmer, &amp; two leagues to the northwards of Hoſmes ground, lyeth a poynt called Steenſoe,<note place="margin">Steenſoe.</note> which is a ſomewhat high rough and very foule poynt, a halfe league long, lying within, a halfe league neare to the towne, to the weſtwards of it runneth in a great bight, where is good lying alſo for manie ſhipps, but you cannot come in there, becauſe of the manie foule grounds and dangers, except it be with a very skilfull Pilot: upon the weſt ſide, over againſt the poynt ſtandeth a white houſe. The King of Denmarks fleet of ſhips laye there, in the time of the laſt ſiege of Calmer.</p>
                     <p>When you come ſo farre in, that you leeſe the ſouth end of Oeland out of your ſight, then you get the Caſtle of Calmer<note place="margin">Caſtle of Calmer.</note> in ſight, ſayle towards it but ſhunne the ſhoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as hath been ſayde here before. The Caſtle hath four great towers, when the two eaſtermoſt of the four come one in the other, then is the Caſtle about north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from you, then you come by the Grimſchaer,<note place="margin">Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchaer</note> this is a rock eaſy to be knowne, upon it ſtandeth a maſt, with a Barrell upon the toppe of it, which lyeth much nearer the weſt ſhoare then Oeland, when you get it in ſight, then ſayle towards it. Thwart of the Grimſchaer or Tonholm lyeth a ſunken rock, about a cables length off from it, and a little more to the eaſtwards, upon it is no more then five foot water.</p>

                        <p>Betwixt Colbergen and Garſhead it is all a flat even ſtrand and ground, without any bancks. In the fareway betwixt Bruntholm and Reefcoll, it is ſeven and twenty and eight and twenty fathom deep, but farre to the northwards of it is at leaſt five and thirty and eight and thirty fathom deep.</p>
                        <p>Northweſt from Reefcoll foure or five leagues from the land, lyeth a banck of nine, ten, and eleven fathom, when you come from Bruntholm, and Reefcoll com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee ſoutheaſt and by eaſt from you, then you come againſt this banck, and endeth when Reefcoll is ſouth and by eaſt from you.</p>
                        <p>From this foreſayd banck towards Bruntholm, it is five and twenty, thirty, and ſix and thirty fathom deep, ſoft clay ground, but towards Reefcoll it is ſhoaler.</p>
                        <p>If you caſt the lead often, ſayling alongſt that coaſt, you ſhall finde more bankes.</p>
                        <p>You may boldly ſaile alongſt this coaſt by night, or darke weather in eight, ten or twelve fathom off from Reefcoll untill about the Roſehead. Thwart of the Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it is farre flat, and round as riffe ground. When you come paſt or about Roſehead it is very deep.</p>
                        <p>When the Roſe-head is ſouthſouthweſt from you about a league, there it is thirty fathom deepe, but very uneven and full of bancks, and the ground white groſſe ſand.</p>
                        <p>Roſe-head being ſoutheaſt from you, it is eight and twenty fathom deepe, with red ſtony ground, almoſt like as if it were riffe ſand.</p>

                     <p>FRom the Roſe-head to the Heele, the courſe is ſoutheaſt eight or nine leagues diſtant. When you come neere the Heele, you are allmoſt ground off in thirty fathom. On the coaſt of the Heele cloſe by the land, it is four and twenty and alſo thirty fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>Under the Heele<note place="margin">Roade under the Heele.</note> you may anchor in twelve; and twenty fathom cloſe by the land, the ground there goeth off very much. If you be a little off from the land, then you are ground off, not very farre without the land you have no ground in fourty fathom. A league to the northwards off the Heele there runneth of a flat from the land, where you muſt take heed, when you will go to anchor under the Heele, you may anchor on both ſides of the Heele, but on the innerſide it is ſoft ground.</p>
                     <p>From the Heele to Danske before the Wiſſell, the courſe is ſouth and by weſt 5 leagues. If you will anchor before the Wiſſell, then anchor to the weſtwards of the Cheſts, or the Weſter-head in ten or twelve fathom.</p>
                     <p>But for to ſayle into the Wiſſell, or the Danske Deep<note place="margin">Danske Deep.</note> you muſt look for out the two maſts with barrels upon them, which ſtandeth upon the Cheſts, or the Weſter-head, bring one in the other, and ſayle in right with them, in betwixt the Cheſts, but when you are within Termunde, you muſt chuſe the eaſter ſhoare, for the Weſt ſhoare is flat, when you come before Boatſams flat, you muſt chuſe the ſide off the Green-ſhoare, and make there faſt with foure hawſers or cables.</p>

                     <p>From the Wiſſell to the Quinsbrough-deep &amp; al al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ongſt to the northwards of it, it is altogether a faire white ſandy ſtrand, upon both ſides off the deep ſtand ſome withered trees, to ſee to as if they were burnt, but upon the ſouth ſide ſtand two Capes, or beakons. If you wil ſayle in there, bring the capes one in the other, when you come in 10 or 8, fathom, and ſayle in ſo right with them, and ſo you ſhall run right with the buyes, which lye on both ſides of the Deepe to 8 or 10 in number, to wit, on each ſide foure or five, ſayle in betwixt them, untill you come within in the Kettell. There is no certainty to be written of the lying in of this channell, as alſo of the the Danske deep, whereunto men might truſt, for by reaſon of the ſcouring of the Freſhuts, and with great ſtreaming of the Ice, they doe change oftentimes, and ſometimes in ſhort time, but the Lords of the land there have very great care to give charge, that they be alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes well ſet with buyes and beakons.</p>
                     <p>For to anchor in the road without the deep, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor ſo that the poynt of Lockſteed lye about north and by eaſt from you, there it is eight, nine and ten fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>Within the Deep in the Kettell, men do lye to tarrie for the wind in three fathom and three fathom and a halfe.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle up the Haff go out of the Kettel about e. untill you come againſt the Heert, and ſoutheaſt over it and then alongſt the Haff amidſt the channell unto the Haverſtrome, the courſe is moſt eaſt. Being over the Heert edge ſomewhat to the ſouth ſhoare for to avoyd that riff which lyeth off from the north ſhoare about a third part into the Haffe, to wit; from the point by eaſt Fiſhouſes there lyeth a little buye upon it, and come no neerer it then twelve or thirteene foot. The right fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is to the ſouthwardes of it fourteen and fifteen foote ſoft ground, untill about Brandenburgh, from thence further it is by little and little ſhoaler twelve, eleven and ten foot upon the Haverſtraw. When you get the ſteeple of Quinsbrough in ſight, then you ſhall ſee alſo by it a round black little wood; keep the ſteeple on the north or eaſt ſide off that little wood, untill that you be paſt Brandenburgh, then let the ſteeple come a ſhips length to the eaſtwards of the little wood of trees, &amp; ſayle ſo right with it, till you come by the buyes or little trees of the Haverſtraw, there you muſt run through amidſt the channell betwixt them, untill you come into the Pregell which lieth up northeaſt unto the towne.</p>
                     <p>From der Pillo to Quinsbrough are about eight lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, but to Melven<note place="margin">Melven.</note> it is about 9 leagues, you muſt alſo ſayle up there amidſt the channell about ſouthweſt, but the poynt over againſt the Pillo, where the caſtle Terba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtandeth, you muſt avoid ſomewhat, which runneth far off flat.</p>
                     <p>Foure or five leagues north and north and by weſt from the Quinsbrough Deep lyeth the poynt of Bruſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roort, and betwixt them both Loocſteed, whereupon ſtandeth a Caſtle with a Church, not farre one from the other, and alſo two high hommocks or hills, and the land there abouts is all full of trees.</p>
                     <p>From Bruſteroort to the Deepe off Der Memell,<note place="margin">Der Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell.</note> the courſe is northeaſt and by north ſixteen or ſeventeen leagues. It is there betwixt them both a faire ſtrand, and the land lyeth in a great bay. The deep of Der Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell lyeth in northeaſt, and northeaſt and by eaſt, and is two fathom deep, within it you come into a great Haffe: you may runne to the weſtwards about the poynt, and anchor there where you will.</p>
                     <p>From Der Memell to Heyligena, the coaſt lyeth north &amp; by eaſt four leagues.</p>
                     <p>From Heyligena to the poynt of Sevenbergen, north and by eaſt, five leagues, that is with hommocks and hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land.</p>
                     <p>Foure or five leagues north and by eaſt from Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen lyeth Terlyba.<note place="margin">Terlyba.</note> There goeth into the land a little river, but there can go in no ſhippes, there is no more then ſix foot water. On the north ſide of the river ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Gentlemans houſe or Caſtle, with a turret upon the midſt of it, the north end of the houſe is covered with boards, and the ſouthend with red tyles, to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or the eaſtwards of it ſtand alſo ſome houſes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered alſo with tyles, in betwixt two woods to ſee to. If you will anchor in the road of Terlyba, then anchor a little to the ſouthwards of the village ſo that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Gentlemans-houſe with the turret doe ſtand eaſt and by north from you in foure fathom and a half, and five fathom leſſe two foot, there is the beſt road and ground that is thereabouts. When you come out of the ſea, and fall with the land to the eaſtwards or to the northwards of Terlyba, you ſhall ſee within the land a black wood, and the houſes in a ragged valley of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills.</p>
                     <p>From Terlyba to Derwinda, the courſe is northnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt ſixteen, or ſeventeen, leagues, betwixt them both the land lyeth in a bight, ſo that the coaſt alongſt by the ſhoare lyeth not ſo right, eſpecially four or five leagues by ſouth Derwinda, there it falleth away into a great bight, which men do call Sackerwyke,<note place="margin">Sacker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyke.</note> and alſo with more ſmaller bights and bayes towards Terlyba.</p>

Thwart of Lyſerorte run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth off a great uneven ſhoale, at leaſt two leagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſea, but you need not feare of it, you may runne over it in four, five or ſix fathom by the lead, like as alſo alongſt all the coaſt of Coerland from Derwinda, untill about Domeſnes.</p>

                     <p>If you will goe to Rye, and comming out of the ſea doe fall with the land about Derwinda, then leave not the coaſt of Coerland, but runne about by it upon the lead, all along unto Domeſnes in four, five, ſixe or ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, according as you have the wind, that you may not fall without, or to the weſtwards of that riffe Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verorte. The channell betwixt Coerland and that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd riffe is fourteen, fifteen and ſixteen fathom, but very uneven. The ground upon the ſhoale thwart of Lyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorte is at ſome places alſo very uneven for to ſound, ſometimes ſixe, ſometimes eight and nine fathom, the one caſt at leaſt two or three fathom more or leſſe then the other, and that not very farre from the land but you need not feare of it, you may bouldly runne to the ſhoare in four and five fathom.</p>
                     <p>But if (when you come out of the ſea) you are paſt Lyſerorte, and come with the land to the northwards of it againſt Oeſell, then you have deeper water, for not far to the weſtwards without Swalverorte<note place="margin">Marks to ſhunne Swalver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orte.</note> it is thirty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep. If you can ſee Oeſel and Coerland, and that the Doembergh be eaſtſoutheaſt or ſoutheaſt &amp; by eaſt from you, then runne on ſoutheaſt untill you come neare Coerland, for to avoyd Swalverorte, and then alongſt by it upon your lead towards Domeſnes, as is beforeſayd. Or when as you have the Doembergh eaſtſoutheaſt from you, then keepe it ſo ſtanding from you, and ſayle in ſo right with it, and then you ſhall (without hurt) runne alongſt over the taile of the outermoſt ſhoale of Swalve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorte, it ſhoaleth up there very ſoone and ſuddainly from 13 or 15 and nine fathom, but if you bringe the eaſt ſide of the Doembergh not more ſoutherly from you then eaſtſoutheaſt and ſoutheaſt and by eaſt then you ſhall not meet with any dangers of the Dwaelgrounds, nor of Swalverorte, you ſhall thus ſayle alongſt at leaſt three leagues over the Dwaelgrounds and Swalverorte, over very uneven grounds, the one caſt at leaſt twelve, the other nine, and alſo wel ſeven, and ſixe fathom, but goe on your courſe without feare, when as the Inner ſide, or eaſt ſide of the ſouth end of Oeſel commeth to be north, and north and by eaſt from you, then you are over the riffe, within all the foule grounds that might hurt you, when as that you get then 13 or 14 fathom, then ſayle bouldly without fear towards Domeſnes.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould happen, that with a northweſt winde, you ſhould fall with the land to the northwards of Derwinda or Lyſerorte, &amp; ſhould fear to come neere the Coaſt of Coerland, then keepe not further off to Sea, then that the eaſt poynt of Doembergh be eaſtſoutheaſt from you, when as then you bring the eaſt ſide of the ſouth point of Oeſell northnortheaſt from you, then you ſhall runne alongſt over Swalverorte in ſeven fathom. Betwixt Oeſel and Coerland it is ſixteen and ſeventeen fathom deep. When as Domeſnes is ſoutheaſt and by eaſt, and the ſouth poynt of Oeſel northweſt and by north from you, and that you are a like neare to them both there it is eighteen farhom deep.</p>
                     <p>From the poynt of Domeſnes runneth off alſo a riffe northeaſt and by north, or a little more northerly a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and half into the ſea, which is on the eaſt ſide very ſteepe, but on the weſt ſide ſomewhat flatter.</p>
                     <p>When you come from out of the weſt, and are bound to Rye you may runne about by it upon your lead, in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 fathom, ſo neare as you will, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the winde and weather ſhall be, I know of ſome that have ſounded about it in foure, and foure fathom &amp; half: but he that will runne ſo ſomewhat neare about it muſt be very carefull in uſing of his lead, &amp; not let it reſt.</p>
                     <p>Not very farre from the riffe, on the weſt ſide, it is 12 and 13 fathom deep. When as the poynt of Domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where the withered trees ſtande upon come to bee ſouthſouthweſt from you, then you come on againſt the weſt ſide of the riffe, when that poynt is ſouthweſt and by ſouth from you, then you are right thwart of the poynt, but when it is ſouthweſt, and ſouthweſt and by weſt from you, then you are about the riffe, and then you may bouldly goe on ſoutheaſt towards Rye. Domeſnes and the Deep of Rye lye ſoutheaſt &amp; northweſt twenty leagues diſtant.</p>
                     <p>About eight leagues to the eaſtwards or to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Domeſnes runneth off another riffe from a poynt which you may ſound about in five &amp; ſix fathom. The land betwixt Domeſnes and that poynt lyeth about ſouthſoutheaſt, and northnorthweſt, but to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it, it falleth away to the ſouth; ſo that betwixt this poynt, and the Deep of Rye, there is a great bay, which is called the Kowerwyck:<note place="margin">Kower<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wy ke.</note> ſomewhat to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of this poynt in the bay, lyeth ſome high land, which lyeth from the Deepe of Rye w. and by ſ. and e. and by north. It muſt be very cleare weather when you can ſee it, lying at anchor before the deepe of Rye.</p>
                     <p>When as (comming from Rye) you ſhall be ſomewhat to the ſouthwards in the Koperwike, and come running out there by the ſhoare, this foreſayd poynt hath thus oftentimes been miſtaken for Domeſnes, becauſe that then you can ſee no Land without it, but when as you come about the point, you ſhall againe ſee the Land out a head, then you are yet about 8 leagues from Domeſnes.</p>
                     <p>Under the poynt of Domeſnes you may anchor on both ſides, as well to the weſtwards as to the eaſtwards. If you will anchor to the weſtwards of it, then anchor in 6, 7 or 8 fathom, there you have good ſand ground, and ſheltred for eaſt and ſoutheaſt winds. If you wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to the eaſtwards of it, then anchor in 6 or 7 fathom, a little within the poynt of the land, ſo that the poynt be north or north and by weſt from you, there is good ſandie ground, &amp; good lying for a ſouthſouthweſt weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northweſt and northnorthweſt winde: the point of the riffe lyeth then from you about northnortheaſt a league and half. If you will anchor further from the ſhoare, ſo that the poynt of Domeſnes be northweſt or northweſt &amp; by north from you, there it is eighteen and twentie fathom deep &amp; ſoft ground.</p>
                     <p>If that you are comming off from Rye againſt the riff of Domeſnes, you will ſail about it,<note place="margin">Road un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnes.</note> then you muſt run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne farre enough about without it, or if you will take it ſomewhat near, you muſt be exceeding carefull in uſing your lead. It is (as hath bene ſayd) verie ſteepe on the eaſt ſide, with a northweſt waye, (which runneth thwart into the riffe) you ſhall have the one caſt twelve nine, or eight, and the next caſt four, or three fathom, if you fall within the poynt of the riffe. But if you have been at anchor under Domeſnes, and ſet ſayle from thence and will ſayle about the riffe, then you may the better runne about it by your lead. Goe from thence northnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and northeaſt &amp; by north, that runneth moſt alongſt by the riffe. When the point off Neſſe commeth about weſt from you, then it will be by little and little ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhoaler, you muſt not ſpare your lead, but muſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und often. With a northweſt courſe come not nearer it then in nine ten or twelve fathom. When the poynt of Nes commeth to be ſouthweſt from you, you may run about ſound it ſo in five, ſixe or 7 fathom, then you come to the eaſt ſide of the riffe, when that is ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt &amp; by ſouth from you, then you are right thwart of the point of the riffe, but when it is ſouthſouthweſt from you, then you are about the riffe, go then weſt ſouthweſt or more ſoutherly towardes Coerland, and runne alongſt by it, in five, ſixe or ſeven fathom (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the winde ſhall be) toward Luſeroort.</p>
                     <p>If you ſayle from Rye with an eaſt or northeaſt winde, &amp; ſhall ſaile by night about the rif, then ſet your courſe ſo, that you be ſure you run farre enough alongſt to the n. wards, or without the Riffe, &amp; keepe that courſe untill that you come neare the grounds of Ambroock or Oeſel in 15 or 16 fathom, then you ſhall be without doubt paſt the riffe, then goe on a while ſouthweſt, untill that you reckon the poynt of Domeſnes to be ſoutheaſt, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more eaſterly from you, then edge up to the coaſt of Coerland by your lead, and runne alongſt by it, in four, five, ſixe or ſeven fathom, as hath been beforeſayd.</p>

                     <p>Eaſt and by north ſomewhat eaſterly eight leagues from Domeſnes lyeth the Iſland Round:<note place="margin">Round.</note> you may runne round about it by your lead, in ſix or ſeven fathom. All alongſt the ſouthweſt ſide it is all foule and ſharp rockie ground, therefore come not nearer the ſhoare there, then in 6 fathom. Southſoutheaſt about a halfleague from the ſouth poynt lyeth a little plate, where upon it is not deeper then ſix foot, there hath once a man beaten off his rudder. It lyeth betwixt ſeven and eight fathom deepe, for to avoyd that, take thereabouts the ſounding of the ſhoare in five or ſixe fathom, and then you run through betwixt it and the ſhoare, or els if you keepe in eight or nine fathom, then you runne about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>If you will anchor under Round<note place="margin">Road un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Round</note> for a ſouthſouthweſt, ſouthweſt or weſtſouthweſt winde, then runne about the ſoutheaſt poynt, untill you come to the eaſt ſide, there is a little bay, where ſtand a few houſes with a chappell, which you can ſee when you come ſomewhat neare to the ſhoare, anchor thwart of it in five fathom, ſo that the chappell doe ſtand ſouthweſt from you, there is the beſt road under Round, being clean ſandy ground, but when it bloweth hard the ſea commeth rouling in. At other places it is not very cleane.</p>
                     <p>The fareway betwixt Round and Domeſnes is two and twenty and three and twenty fathom deepe, and betwixt Round and Duynemond three &amp; twenty &amp; four and twenty fathom.</p>
                     <p>From Round to the Deepe of Rye, it is ſouthſoutheaſt, 15 leagues. Before the Deepe of the river Duyn you may anchor in tenne fathom, either to the ſouthwards or the northwards of it, where you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Deep of the river of Rye<note place="margin">The Deep of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Rye</note> is Pilots water, as well in ſayling up, as ſayling off. How men ſhall ſayle there in or out it is not poſſible to deſcribe, ſo that men might relye upon it, for by reaſon of the continuall ſcowring of the ſtream, and eſpecially by ſome extraordinarie great freſhuts, and ſtrong drifts of yce, the depths and ſhoales do there often ſhift and change, where of every one that is bound thither may be mindfull of.</p>
                     <p>From the Deepe of Rye to Parno, the courſe is north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northeaſt and northeaſt and by north five and twenty leagues, betwixt them both, about fourteene leagues from Rye lyeth a little towne called Lemſael<note place="margin">Lemſael.</note> or Sales, there goeth in a little deepe of eight foot water. Before that Deepe lyeth a banck, which you may ſayle about on both ſides, and come within it, there it is three fathom deep. The Iſland Kyn<note place="margin">Kinne.</note> lyeth from Sales northweſt and by weſt 7 leagues: from Round eaſt and eaſt and by north ſeven leagues, and from the Deepe of Rye north and by eaſt about 14 or 15 leagues. It is a little low Iſland, about 2 leagues long, &amp; hath round about it moſt foule ground. Betwixt Kyn &amp; the coaſt of Lyfland it is 7 leagues broad, and the right deep betwixt them both is 8 and 9 fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>Northweſt eight leagues from Round, and north and by eaſt ſeven leagues from Domeſnes lyeth Ambrook,<note place="margin">Ambrook</note> that is a little Iſland, which is round about foul, with ſharpe ſtony ground, and lyeth two leagues diſtant from the coaſt of Oeſell.

                     <p>From great Roge to the Iſland Narghen, the courſe is eaſt ſomewhat northerly five leagues.</p>
                     <p>When you ſayl from great Roge towards Narghen, you ſhall finde four leagues to the eaſtwards of great Roge an other poynt with two white chalck ſpots, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Surp, betwixt it and great Roge, the land falleth away to the ſouthwards, into a great baye. If you will ſaile to Revell, then ſail alongſt by that poynt of Surp, towards Narghen, leaving it on the larboard ſide off you, going on ſtill eaſt, untill you come to the eaſt end of Nargen. Being there by it, then goe on eaſtſoutheaſt a league and an half, and then you ſhall come by the end of the riffe, which lyeth off from the Blote Karels,<note place="margin">Riffe off the Karels.</note> come no nearer it then in ſixe fathom. When as the caſtle of Revel commeth without the Karels, then ſayl right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head of Revell<note place="margin">Revell.</note> untill you come to the eaſt ſide, let your anchor fall there, and then hawl with the fore-ſhip or ſtearne, to the head, and make you faſt by foure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for the north and northnorthweſt windes which blow there flat open in, making it a lee ſhoare, ſo that ſometimes with ſuch winds there commeth in a rowling ſea.</p>
                     <p>Eaſt about 4 leagues from the ſouth end of Nargen, lyeth the Iſland the Wolfe, which is about a league long.</p>
                     <p>Northnorthweſt, and northweſt and by north two leagues from the weſt end of the Iſland the Wolf, and northeaſt and northeaſt and by eaſt from the north end of Nargen lyeth a rock under water, called the Revel-ſtone, although there be no more water upon then 3 or 4 foot, yet it is in the Summer time with faire weather, oftentimes ſo ſmooth water, that it doth not break upon it, and it is alſo very ſteep, ſo that you may not come neerer it by your lead then in 12 fathom. The markes for to knowe the place of this Revel-ſtone<note place="margin">Revell-ſtone.</note> are theſe: When the northeaſt end of Nargen is ſouthweſt and ſouthweſt and by weſt from you, and the high ſteeple of Revell is a capſtane barrs length, or a little more to the weſtwards off the weſt end of the Iſland the Wolfe, then you are right thwart of this rock. The ſteeple of Revel is alſo the right ſouth from you. But when the ſteeple of Revell commeth to the Wolfe,<note place="margin">The Wolf</note> and that you are bound to the eaſtwards, and you are ſurely paſt this Revell-ſtone, and a good wayes to the eaſtwards of it.</p>
                     <p>From the weſt end of the Iſland the Wolfe lyeth off a riff to the northwards into ſea, about an Engliſh mile toward the Revell-ſtone, upon the end of this riffe lye five or ſixe rocks a little above water. If you come away from Revell on north and by weſt alongſt by the Wolf, then marke the poynt of Surp, when that commeth even unto the ſouth end of the Iſland Nargen, then you ſhall alſo have even the length of the foreſayd riffe. If you looke out then on the ſtarboard ſide, and be not ſayled very ſarre alongſt to the weſtwardes of the Wolf, you ſhall ſee the foreſayd rockes (lying upon the end of the riffe) lye thwart from you, and then you may run to the northwards about by them in five fathom without doing amiſſe.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Nargen and the Wolf lyeth alſo a ſtony ſhoale which is very broad, but much neerer Narghen then the Wolf, and lyeth from the ſouth poynt or Narghen<note place="margin">ſhoale of Nargen.</note> about northeaſt, and from the north poynt eaſtſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt. Therfore if you bring the ſouth poynt of Nargen about ſouthweſt or ſouthweſt and by ſouth, and the foreſayd north point weſtnorthweſt from you, and that the Wolf lye then free from the mayne land, you ſhall not miſſe to fall upon this ſhoale.</p>
                     <p>You may ſayle round about Nargen,<note place="margin">Nargen.</note> and alſo anchor
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170755:136"/> under it for northerly and weſterly winds in 10, 12, 14 &amp; 18 fathom.</p>
                     <p>From Nargen to the Iſland Wranger, the courſe is eaſt, ſeven leagues. The lying there of you may ſee in the following directions.</p>

                     <p>South and by eaſt about two leagues from the great Tutters lyeth a ſhoale of five fathom. He that will ſayle to the ſouthwards of theſe foreſayd Iſlands and ſhoales<note place="margin">Shoale.</note> towards the Narve, may be mindfull thereof, it lyeth about foure leagues to the eaſtwards of Telsburgh: two or three leagues from the ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt the great Tutters &amp; Highland lyeth a ſhoale upon which there is no more then ſix foot water.</p>
                     <p>Southeaſt a great halfe league from the ſouth end off Highland lyeth another ſhoale of a fathom and halfe and two fathom deep.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards off al theſe foreſayd rocky Iſlands and ſowle ſhoales, lyeth a little Iſland whereupon ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Maſt for to know it by, &amp; to deſcerne it from the other little fowle Iſlands, that you may come indifferent near to it, but not too near, for it is alſo ſomewhat rocky and fowle, but not farre off, it lyeth from the little Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters weſt and by north and weſt northweſt about three leagues, from the Iſland Highland ſouthweſt &amp; by weſt at leaſt foure or five leagues, but from Wranger eaſt ſomewhat ſoutherly eighteen or nineteen leagues.</p>
                     <p>He that will ſayle off from Wranger towards the Narve alongſt to the northwardes of theſe foreſayd grounds, and doth get ſight of this little Iſland with the maſt, may thereby the better know to direct his courſe but it is not wiſdome to ſayle through theſe foreſayd ſhoales, except for them that are very well acquaited.</p>
                     <p>The Iſland Highland or Hooghland,<note place="margin">Highland or Hoogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> is about four leagues long, and a league broad-lying ſouthſoutheaſt &amp; northnorthweſt. When you come out of the weſt, it ariſeth in three hommocks, ſo high to ſee to as Coll in the Sea reach, upon the north end and upon the eaſt ſide it doth ſtand all full of trees. A little about the north point on the eaſt ſide is a little bay thwart of a Boers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, there it is clean ground and good lying for weſterly ſ.w. winds, ſomewhat to the ſouthwards of it, not very far from the ſhoare, lyeth a great rock above water. At the north end is alſo good lying for a ſoutheaſt wind. Alongſt the ſouthweſt ſide you may alſo anchor every where in ſixteen, ſeventeen, or eighteen fathom cloſe by the land for eaſt &amp; northeaſt winds.</p>
                     <p>From the ſouthweſt ſide of Highland unto the road of the Narve, the courſe is ſoutheaſt and ſoutheaſt and by ſouth about fifteen leagues, &amp; then you run through betwixt the Highland &amp; the Tutters.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe when as you ſayle on northweſt from the roade of the Narve, then you run alongſt betwixt the Tutters and Highland, but you muſt be very carefull, and take heed off the foreſayd ſhoales, which ly betwixt them both.</p>
                     <p>The land of the Narve men do know by three high hills, lying a league to the weſtwards, or to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the road, and a league further to the weſtwards ſtand ſome little houſes upon the high land.</p>
                     <p>The towne of the Narve<note place="margin">The Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</note> lyeth upon a river about two leagues within the land. For to ſayle in there men were wont to look out for a long hill, which lyeth on the ſouth ſide within the rivers mouth, and at the eaſt end goeth downe ſomewhat ſteep, with ſome high trees to the eaſtwards of it, then they brought the woodden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Narve to the northwards of the foreſayd trees, and did run in ſo with it. When as the eaſtermoſt of the three foreſayd hills (a league to the weſtwards of the rivers mouth) come over a little hommocke, which lyeth on the water ſide, then they were upon the barre of the rivers mouth, there was upon the ſhoaleſt ten foot water, and then they ſayled up the river, that was wont (for ſome years) to be ſo, but it is poſſibly ſince that time more or leſſe altered, like as it doth oftentimes happen in ſuch rivers.</p>
                     <p>From the road of the Narve to the Ruſſe-haecks,<note place="margin">Ruſſe-haecks.</note> the courſe is north and by weſt five leagues, which lye with many rocks a good wayes off from the ſhoare. The point thwart of it is called the poynt of Caſtrum after a little town (ſo called) lying there.</p>
                     <p>From the Ruſſe-haecks north 5 leagues lyeth a little Iſland, called Rette Sarre,<note place="margin">Rette-Sarre.</note> from which there runneth off a rif ſouth into ſea. From this Iſland, to the Summers, the courſe is north and by weſt, weſterly 4 or 5 leag.</p>
                     <p>Eaſtſoutheaſt and ſoutheaſt and by eaſt from High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp; three leagues from the Ruſſe-haecks lyeth another ſhoale, called the Slimme grounds,<note place="margin">Slimme-grounds.</note> it lyeth long &amp; ſmall alongſt northnorthweſt and ſouthſoutheaſt, with hard wind you may ſee it break in foure or five places: when it is weſt from you about halfe a league, there it is two fathom deep to 3, 4, 5 and 6 fathom uneven ground, ſome of the rocks of it lye alſo above water.</p>
                     <p>From the Ruſſe-haecks to the Rode-hell, the courſe is northeaſt and by north about three and twenty leagues, betwixt them both on the Ruſſe ſide, runne alſo divers rivers into the land, but there it no trade. The land there lyeth in a great bight, it lyeth firſt from the Ruſſe-haecks unto the River of Nioa, or Oreſchacke eaſtnortheaſt about 22 leagues, that parteth Ruſland from Finland by a great Meer or water, called the Lading.<note place="margin">The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note>

                        <p>From a little to the northwards of the Kocxſchaer to Highland, the courſe is eaſt and by north a little more eaſterly 23 leagues, with that courſe you runne alongſt a little to the northwards of it. You may ſayle about Highland on both ſides, but alongſt to the northwards of it is the right fare-way for theſe that are bound to Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough. A halfe league north and by weſt from Highland lyeth a ſunken rock under water. For to avoyd it you muſt ſayle cloſe alongſt by Highland. Further, the lying of Highland hath been deſcribed here before.</p>
                        <p>From Highland to the Summers,<note place="margin">Summers.</note> the courſe is eaſt ſeven leagues. Summers is a rock or little Iſland al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like the Eartholms, it ſheweth it ſelfe in 3 hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks.

                        <p>From the Summers to the Goeſchaer,<note place="margin">Goeſchaer of greate Fiſhers.</note> the courſe is northeaſt and by north more eaſterly ſeven leagues. The Goeſchaer which by ſome is called the great Fiſher is a long &amp; broken Iſland of 7 rocks, therefore it is alſo called the Seven-rocks, it lyeth not far from the land, ſo that you cannot get ſight of it, before that you come nearer it, it ſheweth it ſelfe when you ſhall firſt ſee it, in 4 hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, as if it were 4 little low Iſlands, you muſt leave it lying a halfe league on the larboard ſide, for to avoid a ſunken rock which lyeth off from it ſouthſoutheaſt a great ſhot of a caſt peece. When the water is not very
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170755:140"/> ſmooth, but a little grown, you may perceive it by the breaking of the water: you may alſo well ſayle to the northwards of this ſunken rock, to wit, through betwixt the ſuncken rock &amp; the Goeſchaer; then you muſt run indifferent cloſe alongſt by Goeſchaer; when it is north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt and by north from you, then you are paſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd ſuncken rock, whether that you run alongſt to the northwards or to the ſouthwards of it. Northweſt and by north behind the greate Fiſher you may anchor in a good haven, betweene the cliffes where upon the ſouth Corner of a cliff there ſtandeth a warder, wherein if you lye there you are free from all Icedrifts.</p>
                        <p>From the Goeſchaer or great Fiſher to the little Fiſher, the courſe is northeaſt and by eaſt three leagues. The little Fiſher is a bare round rock which lyeth not farre from the land: when you come neere it, you may know it well from the other rockes, becauſe there lye none farre from the land alone, you may ſayle about it on both ſides, but alongſt to the ſouthwards of it is the right fareway. About a ſhot of a caſt peece ſoutheaſt, or ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and by eaſt from this little Fiſher, lyeth a black rock with the top even above water, almoſt like a buye upon the Flyeſtreame, to ſee to a farre off as if it where a Seales head. This rock you muſt leave on the ſtarboard ſide, and run through betwixt it and the Fiſher but there is a piece of it driven off with a ſtrong Icedrift ſo that as many ſay there is not much feare to bee made of it.</p>
                        <p>Hee that muſt turne to windwards thereabouts, let him not come very neer this rock, for men doe hold that there lye more rockes by it under water.</p>
                        <p>Both the Fiſhers are otherwiſe clean round about; ſo that you may alſo finde road under them.</p>
                        <p>From the little Fiſher to the poynt Corſnes,<note place="margin">Corſnes.</note> which the Lubickers doe call Kruyſoort, the courſe is eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northeaſt ſomewhat eaſterly a league. Corſnes is a poynt going off low of the maine land, not very clean, which you muſt leave on the larboard ſide. To the weſtwards of Corſnes lye two little Iſlands cloſe to the land. Thwart of the poynt lyeth a rock allmoſt like a boat, you may runne about by it in foure fathom and a halfe, but not neare. On the eaſt ſide of that poynt you may anchor for Weſterly winds in five or ſixe fathom.</p>
                        <p>About two leagues thwart off from Corſnes, lye very many rocks, ſome one fathom, ſome a halfe fathom, ſome more, and ſome leſſe under water, you may not goe out of the fareway without great feare and danger. It is impoſſible to deſcribe all the uneven grounds, the great multitude of rocks &amp; rocky ſhoales which are lying thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>From Corſnes to the Iſland Rodehell,<note place="margin">Rodehell.</note> the courſe is northeaſt and by eaſt about three leagues. Rodehell is a greate rough Iſland with a ſaddle in the middeſt, which you muſt leave lying on the ſtarboard ſide. The north poynt is a red poynt, there ſtand up long ſtaves over end, like unto a Warder in Norway, you muſt goe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe alongſt by them, or you may runne in amidſt the channell, according as ſhall be beſt convenient, but you may not goe cloſe by the north poynt over againſt it (which the Dutch ſhippers doe call Jan Lambertſons poynt) becauſe of a ſtony and ſteepe little riff which lyeth of from it, but you may runn about by it upon your lead in ſeven or eight fathom, but may come no neerer; the right fareway betwixt then both is fourteen and fifteen fathom deep.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt the poynt of Corſnes &amp; the Rode-hell, it is not without danger to turn to windwards, eſpecially you muſt be very carefull not to run too far over to the ſouth wards, but to the northwards, towardes the maine land it is indifferent cleane: It is there in the fareway fifteen fathom deepe, ſoft clay-ground.</p>
                        <p>For not to miſſe this foreſayd channell; or the north point of the Rode-hell, then take the mark out a ſtearne of the little Fiſher, bring that even without the poynt of Corſnes, &amp; keep it ſo ſtanding ſayling towards the Rode-hell, and ſo you ſhall not fayle to fal right before the channell. This is a ſure mark whereupon you may truſt. If you fall ſomewhat to the ſouthwards of the foreſaid channell, you can ſee opening, but ſeemeth to be all whole to the maine land, ſo that men (that are not well acquainted) might not know where to ſeek the channell, but ſayling to the northwards the channell doth open itſelf.</p>
                        <p>When as you ſhall be then within the foreſayd poynt of Rode-hell, you may anchor there where you pleaſe, &amp; fetch a Pylot from the land, which may bring you up to the towne Wybrough. It is there within fifteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep, and good ſoft clay-ground.</p>
                        <p>If you wil (being come within the Rode-hell) ſaile up to Wybrough, then goe on eaſt and by ſouth a ſhot of a caſt peece unto a black point, leave that about 2 cables lengths on the larboard ſide, for there it is not cleane. Being a little paſt this black point, then go on northeaſt, or eaſtnortheaſt a halfe league, and then you ſhall come againſt a great white ſand-bay, but before you come by this ſand-bay, you ſhall meet a rock with a gray ſtone like a buye upon the Flyeſtream, leave that foreſayd rock on the ſtarboard ſide, and the gray ſtone on the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, &amp; run amidſt the channell through betwixt them both, there it is three fathom deep. It is in no wiſe to bee done to ſayle up there for him that hath not been re before, but it is beſt to anchor a little within Rodehell &amp; to let him be brought up by a Pylot.</p>

                     <p>When you come before the channell of the Hevering, you can at firſt hardly ſee a channell, or any opening, but bring the great rock the Hevering northweſt from you, &amp; ſayle ſo right in, and run-in cloſe alongſt to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it.

                     <p>About half wayes betwixt the Karels &amp; the ſouth end off Gotland, ſouthſoutheaſt from the Karell, lyeth the haven Boſwyke:<note place="margin">Boſwyke.</note> thwarte of it runneth off a riffe, an the north ſide of the haven a good wayes from the ſhoare, come no nearer it then in ſeven or eight fathom. When you are thwart of the ſouth poynt, about a halfe league from the land, and will ſayle alongſt to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Gotland, you muſt not ſayl on more northerly then northweſt, as well for to avoyd that riffe of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyke, as for to ſayle a weather the Karels.</p>
                     <p>Four leagues northeaſt from the Karel, lieth the Iſland Reefholm,<note place="margin">Reefholm</note> thwarte of it men doe runne into Weſtergorte: you may ſayle &amp; anchor round about it. A little to the northwards of it lyeth the northweſt point of Gotland.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the northwardes of the high poynt lyeth the towne Wiſbuy, about ſeven leagues northeaſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170755:146"/> from the Karell. Men were wont in old tyme to lye there behinde a greate head or Cheſt.</p>
                     <p>Wiſbuy<note place="margin">Wiſbuy.</note> hath beene in tymes paſt a famous marchant towne, where was wont to be driven greate trade of marchandize, but it is now through the will of God, altogether fallen down, and come to nothing. The Hance towns haven a long time there held their ſtaple. The old Sea laws were made there, and alſo the old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Read-carde. Men may ſee yet to this day many old ruinous houſes of coſtly marble and hewen ſtones, whereby men may partly perceive and Judge, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtalteniſſe there hath been.</p>
                     <p>From Wiſbuy the coaſt lieth forth northeaſt &amp; by eaſt towards the end of Gotland about nine leagues. But from the Karell to Gotſhe ſand, the courſe is northeaſt one &amp; twenty or two and twenty leagues: there is a little Iſland, whereupon dwelleth no people, and ſtandeth full of trees: you may ſayle round about it, which hath a white ſtrand. From the northweſt point thereof ſhooteth off a little riff, &amp; likewiſe one from the ſouth point, a good waies off into ſea, towards the north end of Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. On every ſide of Gotſche ſand, you may anchor in ſix, ſeven, eight, nine, ten and twelve fathom, all clean and good anchor ground, but theſe foreſayd riffes you muſt avoid. It lieth northnortheaſt ſix leagues diſtant from Faro, the north end of Gotland, when you ly there under it at anchor, you cannot ſee Gotland.</p>
                     <p>The Copper ſtone lieth from Gotſche ſand north weſt and by weſt diſtant three great leagues.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſouth end of the eaſt ſide of Gotland ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a high tower, called Howbrough, and thereafter the ſouth end of Gotland alſo is called Howbrough. By it goeth in a little river, before which you may anchor in ſix or ſeven fathom.</p>
                     <p>Five leagues northeaſt from the aforeſaid ſouth point lieth Heyligh-holm, which is a good haven, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is but little uſed, it is therefore alſo but little known.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the eaſtwards of Heyligh-holm lieth the haven of Narwyck, upon the eaſt ſide of the Haven lieth a long rock, by which you muſt run in, and leave another ſharp rock on the larboard ſide, within the haven you may anchor in four or five fathom.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues to the eaſtwards of it lieth Sandwyk which is a good haven for a weſt, northweſt, northeaſt, and ſoutheaſt winde, and lieth in about north, a ſouth winde bloweth there open in: On the eaſt point, (which is a low bare point) lieth a Holme, which is faſt to the land, upon it ſtandeth a Warder: From this point run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth off a little ſandriffe, which you may ſound about in five or ſix fathom. Within at this Holm is a bridge of Maſts which lyeth off a little from the ſhoare. If you will anchor there in the Haven, then run in alongſt by the eaſt ſhoare, untill you come within the bridge, and anchor there neareſt ſhoare, ſo that the foreſayd eaſt poynt do ſtand ſoutheaſt, or ſoutheaſt and by ſouth from you, in four fathom, four and an half, or five fathom, there is cleane clay ſand ground, and very eaſy lying for weſt, north and eaſt winds.</p>
                     <p>A league to the eaſtwards of Sandwyck lying the Iſland of Eaſtergore,<note place="margin">Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gore.</note> about halfe wayes betwixt both the ends of Gotland n.e. from the ſ.w. poynt, this is a bare Iſland without trees. Under this Iſland is very eaſy road for all windes, as wel for them that are bound to the eaſtwards, as to the w. wards. Comming from the weſtwards, or from Sandwyck alongſt by the land, then is the northw. poynt, (which is a high bare gray piont) hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behinde a point of the maine land of Gotland, ſo that it ſeemeth a farre off to be no Iſland, but comming near it, it openeth it ſelf, that you may ſee large enough thorough betwixt them: ſayle in there betwixt them both in the midſt of the channell, it is there clean and clear, but ſomewhat une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ground, to wit, eight, ten, twelve and fourteen fathom, but you need not feare. If you will anchor under it for northeaſt or eaſt winds, then anchor betwixt the land and the Iſland, ſo that the aforeſaid bare gray north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt poynt ſtand north, and the ſouthermoſt eaſt from you, in nine or ten fathom. Or if you will anchor for a ſouth, ſouthweſt, or weſt winde, then run further in about by that aforeſaid bare gray poynt, bring it ſouth-ſouthweſt from you, and anchor there in ſeven, eight, nine, or ten fathom, there it is cleane ground of ſmall white &amp; black ſand. A little to the northwards of the Iſland is a great Bay on Gotland, there you may alſo anchor in ſeven and eight fathom, for weſterly windes.</p>
                     <p>If you will ſayl in or out, to the northwards of Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gore then come not very near the Iſland, becauſe there lieth off a riffe from the eaſt point farre into the ſea, which is a great half league without the land, not deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then two fathom &amp; a half, ſtony and very uneven, and is to be throught, that nearer to the land it is ſhoaler and fouler. From the ſoutheaſt ſide runneth off alſo a flat, a good wayes to Seawards, at ſome places not deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then three, four &amp; five fathom, and alſo very uneven, whereof you muſt take heed.</p>
                     <p>Foure leagues north and by eaſt from Eaſtergore lyeth a haven, called Sliet or Sliet haven, lying in north and north and by weſt, behind ſome little Iſlands, there it is good lying for eaſterly, weſterly, &amp; n. winds. Upon one of the norther muſt little Iſlands ſtandeth a ruinous church. You muſt come in there alongſt by the ſhoare from the ſouthwards. From thence to Faroſound the coaſt lyeth north and by weſt two leagues.</p>
                     <p>Faroſound you may run into, in two and three fathom water, there ſtandeth a Church with a flatte ſteeple upon the land, From Faroſound lyeth off a foule danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous riffe, a league and halfe, or 2 leagues into ſea, called Salfonteyn, you muſt take very good heed there of, when you will run about to the northwards of Gotland.</p>
                     <p>From Faroſound to Gotſcheſand, the courſe is north-northeaſt, about 7 leagues.</p>

When the Moon is ſouth, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more weſterly, it beginneth apparantly to flow without on the ſtrand, and likewiſe upon the ſhoals.</p>
                        <p>The fore-flood, and the after-ebbe out of the Teſſel, fall both one with the other n.n. e. thwart over the grounds and channels, and right out at the Spanjards channell, untill halfe flood: &amp;c to the contrary, the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re-ebbe, with the after-flood fall right in at the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jards channell ſ. ſ. eaſt over the ſouth grounds, and thwart over the Slenk and the other channels, untill half ebbe. A little while before half flood, the flood beginneth to runne right in at the channel, and againe a litle before half ebb, the ebbe beginneth to fet right out at the channel. Therefore hee that wil ſayle into the channels, muſt reckon his tydes very wel, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth very much.

Upon theſe entries men cannot well make any reckoning, they keep no certaine depth, when it bloweth a ſtorme out of the ſouth, they are oftentimes caſt too with a chindle, and opened againe with a freſhut.</p>

From the weſt point runneth off a little tayle, but at high water you may runne in alongſt over it, otherwiſe you muſt runne in by the eaſt ſhoare. Upon the eaſt poynt ſtand 2 beacons, which you muſt bring one in the other, &amp; run in ſo right with them untill you come by the n. ſhoare, and then in alongſt by the foreſayd north ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>At Shorum ſomtimes there are builded many great ſhips of 3 or 400 tunnes.</p>

                     <p>For to ſayle into the Eaſtwards of Wight you muſt bring the eaſterne caſtle that lieth to the eaſtwards of Portſmouth over the Lyme-kilne (that is, a white ſpot in the land to the northwards of that caſtle) and keepe them ſoo one over the other, untill that the Culver cliffe come, within or under the northeaſt poynt of Wight.

                     <p>When the eaſtermoſt white ſpot ſtandeth a ſhips length to the weſtwards of the Caſtle, then you are to the eaſtwards of the riffe, and when the Culver cliffe is covered or hidden behind the, n. e. point of the Iſland, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are you alſo within the riffe.

Betwixt the bancks cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Swingels, and the Needles, it is not very broad, and at low water 5 fathom deep. When you ſayle in here, you muſt caſt your tydes well.

                     <p>In the ſound of Plymmouth, not farre to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Mewſtone, lye two or three ſuncken rockes,<note place="margin">Suncken Rocks.</note> upon which remaine at low water not more then three or foure fathom water, the markes of them are theſe: To the eaſtwads of Plymmouth ſtandeth a Tower with a Mill, and to the Weſtwards of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd little Iſland ſtandeth a Gentlemans houſe, when the little tower or turret of that houſe commeth over the poynt on the weſt ſide of the Iſland, &amp; the foreſayd Tower and Mill to the eaſtwards of Plymmouth come one over the other, then are you upon the innermoſt ſuncken rocke or ſhoale, which it at low Water foure fathom deepe. But when the poynt of Hamoaſe commeth even without the poynt to the weſtwards of the Iſland, and the foreſayd Tower and mill alſoo one in the other, Then are you upon the outermoſt rocke, where it is at low water and ſpring-tyde three fathom and a half deepe.</p>
                     <p>From Ramehead weſt &amp; by ſouth five leagues, lyeth Foy, and betwixt them on the coaſt lyeth a little Iſland, a little to the eaſtwards of a poynt, called Talland-poynt, thwart of Weſt-Louwe, called Louw-Iſland,<note place="margin">Low-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> you may anchor there to the eaſterwards of the Iſland in 5 or 6 fathom.</p>
                     <p>Foy<note place="margin">Foy.</note> is a broad haven, where a ſhip may go in at a half flood, at the eaſt-ſide of the haven ſtandeth a little church with a little ſteeple, &amp; on the weſt ſide a white church, ſomewhat greater then that upon the eaſt land with a ſquare ſteeple at the weſt end of it.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle into Foy, you muſt have at leaſt a halfe flood, and runne in midſt the channel betwixt the two poynts, and being come within, then chuſe which ſide you will, but the moſt water is by the weſt land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſtakes and the Tower that ſtandeth upon the weſt land. Being come within the Stakes (as you come in by the weſt land) then beare ſomewhat off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from the weſt ſhoare, almoſt into the middle of the channell, neareſt to the weſt ſhoare, untill you come before the Village that lyeth on the weſt ſide, there is a deepe docke, where a ſhippe that draweth ſixteene foot water may lye a float at low water. In the ſayd dock may 3 or 4 ſhippes lye.</p>
                     <p>If (when you come in by the eaſt land) you deſire to bee in the foreſayd docke or poole, then ſaile in untill you come within the ſtakes, and then edge over off from the eaſt-land untill you come neareſt the weſt land, for to avoyd a Flat, which lyeth by the eaſt ſhoare alongſt the haven, and beginneth againſt the firſt houſe of the Weſt-Village. If it ſhould happen, that you could not lead it in with a ſaile, then let your anchor fall without the ſtakes, &amp; warp in with hawſers, untill you come into the foreſayd poole.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo ſayle ſo farre in, that you may ſee a wall on the weſt ſide of the haven, where lyeth a village behinde it. A ſhippes length to the ſouthwards of that wall, it is good lying by the eaſt land, being moored by foure cables, there may alſoo a ſhip ride a float that draweth ſixteene foot water. You may alſo ſaile further in alongſt by that Swach that lieth on the weſt ſide, wherein the mill ſtandeth, but come not too neare the north poynt of the Swach, for there by it, lyeth a rock under water, being paſt that you may moore your ſhip in the middeſt of the channell, there is beſt lying for ſhippes that draw much water.</p>
                     <p>Foure leagues ſouthweſt and by weſt from Foy, lyeth the poynt of Dodman,<note place="margin">Dodman.</note> &amp; two leagues to the weſtwards of it lyeth the Haven of Falmouth. The poynt of Dodman is double Land with a round hill, which to the weſtwards goeth ſloping downe, ſomewhat towards the weſt end ſtandeth a mill with a ſharp tower, and ſome little houſes upon the land, ſomwhat to the weſtwards, men may ſee the caſtle of Falmouth upon a round Hommocke againſt the high Land. This land is very eaſy to bee known when you come from the weſt, or from the Lizard.</p>
                     <p>Upon the weſt poynt of the haven of Falmouth<note place="margin">Falmouth</note> ſtandeth a Caſtle upon the high land and in the entry neareſt the weſt-ſide, lyeth a great rock above water, you may ſayle about it on both ſides, at the inner ſide of the eaſt point lye alſo ſome rocks off from the ſhoare.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170755:181"/> For to ſayle in there to the eaſtwads, alongſt by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Rocke, you muſt runne in within two cables lengths, alongſt by the eaſtland leaving the foreſayd rocks on the ſtarboard ſide, and the great rocke on the larboard ſide, &amp; ſo ſayle right in with the high land that lyeth on the weſt ſide within the haven. Within in the haven ſtandeth on the Land a white Chalkye ſpot, alſo a little wood of trees, keepe them over the North poynt of the foreſayd high weſt-land, and ſayle ſo right in with them, keeping them ſo untill you come neare them, you ſhall finde ſo at halfe flood, upon the ſhoaleſt, not leſſe Water then five fathom, and that betwixt the foreſayd Caſtle upon the weſt poynt, and the eaſter Caſtle that ſtandeth on the eaſtſide, within the haven, over againſt it, or a little within the Caſtles. When you ſhall then come by that foreſayd high weſt-land, runne alongſt by it, unto the north-end of the ſame, and anchor there in twelve, thirteene, or fourteene fathom. You may alſo from thence edge over towards the eaſt land, &amp; anchor there under or behinde the banck; that lyeth off from the eaſterne Caſtle alongſt the middle of the haven, in ſixe, ſeven or eight fatham: the banck falleth almoſt dry at low water, and is ſoft ground, ſoo that the ſhippes ſit in the oaſe, when they come there a ground.</p>
                     <p>For to ſayle into the weſtwards of the foreſayd great rock, you muſt take the ſounding of the weſt land, where the Caſtle ſtandeth upon, in five or ſixe fathom, being ſomewhat within the rock, runne (as before is ſayd) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt-land. To the weſtwards of the rock, it is in that channell ſix and ſeven fathom deepe at halfe flood, but in the channell to the eaſtwards of the rock, ſeven and eight fathom.</p>
                     <p>Foure leagues ſouth &amp; by weſt from Falmouth lyeth the eaſt poynt of the Lizard, betwixt them both lyeth a haven, called Helford,<note place="margin">Helford.</note> which is little uſed for ſhips.</p>
                     <p>At the ſouth-ſide of the haven lyeth a ſteepe poynt, and on the north-ſide a low ſharpe poynt. Within the haven on the ſouth-ſide, ſtandeth a Gentlemans houſe beneath at the ſtrand, &amp; upon the hill ſtandeth a tuffe of trees, you muſt keepe theſe one in the other, and runne ſo amiddeſt the channell into the entry of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. On the north ſide ſtand alſo 2 or 3 trees, theſe come a maſts length to the weſtwards of a little houſe that ſtandeth in a white ſandy bay, there upon you may ſayle in alſoo amidſt the channell; it is a ſhort in-let, being come within, you may anchor in ſix or ſeven fathom. Upon the ſouth ſide ſtandeth alſo a ſharpe Tower, and upon the north ſide a little Caſtle upon the ſteepe land.</p>
                     <p>The Lizard hath three poynts, the northermoſt is called the Blacke-head, from that to the ſecond the coaſt lyeth ſouthweſt and by weſt, and alongſt to the third about weſtſouthweſt, or weſt and by ſouth: from the ſecond or middelmoſt poynt, lye to ſeawards ſome rocks a cables length, or a cables length and a halfe off, called the Staggs.</p>
                     <p>To the northwards of the northermoſt, or eaſtermoſt poynt of the Lizard, betwixt Helford and the foreſayd poynt lye ſome rockes a great league off from the land, called the Mannackles,<note place="margin">Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nackles.</note> ſouth and by eaſt from the harbour of Falmouth, &amp; eaſtnortheaſt from the foreſayd Blacke-head, where of many of them are above water at low water, and ſome of them at high water remaine uncovered.

There goeth alſo from it a foule ledge off unto the land, ſo that a man may hardly ſayle through betwixt the rocks and the maine land, except a man be extraordinary well acquainted. But betwixt the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rock &amp; the ſouthrock goeth a faire broad Sound through, where men may well turn too and again, and at many places may anchor, it is all over good clean ſandy ground, 6, or 7, and 8 fathom deep.</p>

There betwixt them both lie divers more little Iſlands, rocks, and ſuncken rocks, &amp; ſhoals, for the which men muſt take good heed when they will come neare by the ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>The Kopland Iſles lye about an Engliſh mile from the land, they are upon the off ſide to ſeawards, cleane, but from the inner ſide there goeth off ſome ledges and foule ground, in the mid-way there going through it is 5 &amp; ſix fathom deepe, but it is beſt to goe without, except for them that are well acquainted.

                     <p>The bay of Knockfergus<note place="margin">Bay of Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus.</note> is a great broad Sound; About 3 leagues inwards in the Bay w. from Copland Iſles, is the road before Knockfergus, there is good anchor ground in 3 fathom and a halfe.

There goe ſome Creekes through the ſoule grounds, where men (for need) might ſayle through, but it is no wiſdome to go about it, when there is no need, and that men can do better. Not very long ſince, there came a man (by night unacquainted) there in, and ranne through onely upon the ſight of the breaches of the water, and got through without any hurt, but not without great feare and danger. He that commeth off from the faire Forland, muſt (at leaſt) goe South eaſt and by eaſt, ſor to runne alongſt cleare of theſe foule grounds. From the weſt ſide alſo lieth off a little tayle of a ledge of Rockes towards the land. Further, it is there cleane, that men may ſayle through there within, but men muſt not come nearer the Maydes, then about halfe channell betwixt them and the maine, but the maine land ſo neare as they will, which is both cleane and cleare, with many Bayes, where men may every where anchor, yet here and there lie ſome Rocks, but they are all above water: There is nothing that can hurt you, but men may eaſily ſee it.</p>
                     <p>A great league to the northwards of the north poynt of the Bay of Knock fergus, and a halfe league ſouth ſouthweſt from the Mayds, lieth a haven called Old-fliet<note place="margin">Old fliet.</note> For to know it when men come from the Northwards, they ſhall ſee two flat little Towers, the one ſomewhat higher then the other, like as if men ſaw a ſhip with maine ſayle &amp; foreſayle, without toppe or toppe-ſayles: theſe ſtand upon the northſide of the Bay.</p>

                     <p>From Old-fliet to the northwards unto faire Forland, the coaſt is very cleane, that you may ſayle cloſe alongſt by it, boldly without any feare, except you runne farre off from land, without the foreſaid Maydes towards the Scottiſh coaſt.</p>
                     <p>Faire Hid, or Faire Forland<note place="margin">Faire Fot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> is the outermoſt north eaſt Poynt of the maine land of Ireland, and lieth a little to the ſouthwards of the Iſland Rachleens, ſo that this point and the eaſt point of Rachleens lye neare about ſouth and north one from the other.</p>
                     <p>At Rachleens, or Faire Forland the north eaſt point of Ireland, come Scotland &amp; Ireland neareſt one to the other. The Rachleens is an Iſland that men may ſayle round about, either to the Northwards or to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as they will according as it happeneth beſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient with winde and tyde. At the ſouthweſt ſide is a faire bay, where is good lying almoſt for all windes. When men come from Weſt it ſeemeth to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Rachleens to bee cloſe without any opening, becauſe the eaſtermoſt poynt of Irelands Faire Forland, lyeth ſomwhat further out, behinde the Rachleens, but when they come neerer betwixt them, ſheweth it ſelfe open by little and little. On both ſides are the ſhoares flat and cleane, ſo that men may anchor there where you wil, either by the coaſt of the maine land of Ireland, in 8 or 9 fathom, or in the bay under the Jſland in cleane ſandy ground. Over againſt the Rachleens, cloſe by the maine land, lyeth another little high Iſland, called the Lambs<note place="margin">Lambes Iſland.</note> or ſheeps Iſland, to the ſouthwardes of it betwixt it and the main, men may not ſayle there about it, but betwixt it &amp; the Iſland Rachleen it is broad enough.</p>
                     <p>From the Rachleens unto the Skires Portruſh, the courſe is w. ſ. w. diſtant 7 leag. About 2 leag. to the e. wards off it, in the maine land, lyeth Porto Belletrie, a bad roade for great ſhips, the ground is there fowle and ſharpe.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Porto Belletrie and Skires Portruſh, neereſt unto Skires Portruſh, lye the Chickens,<note place="margin">Chickens.</note> theſe are ſunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rockes, which may be ſayled about on both ſides, for to come to anchor under Skires Portruſh.<note place="margin">Skires.

                     <p>The Skires Portruſh is a rocky Iſland, it hath on the ſouth ſide a faire bay, where you may lye in ſixe and ſeven fathom, cleane &amp; ſandy ground land-lockt for all winds, except for the eaſtnortheaſt winde, which bloweth alongſt the ſhoare there open in. For to come under this Iſland from the eaſt, you muſt goe cloſe alongſt by the ſhoare off the maine land, for to ſhun theſe foreſayd ſuncken rockes the Chickens. It is there all over cleane and cleare: or els if you were minded to goe without, or to the ſouthward off the Chickens, for to come under the Iſland, you muſt ſhun the Eaſt poynt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170755:197"/> of the Iſland, becauſe of a ſuncken rocke that lyeth a little off from the eaſt poynt of the Iſland. At the northweſt ſide of this bay is alſo a ſmall narrow channell, where you may ſayle through.</p>
                     <p>A little to the weſtwards of Skires Portruſh lyeth the Bant-haven,<note place="margin">Bant-haven.</note> there alongſt you may ſayle up unto the new Towne Colran, it is a bad channell to come in, as well by reaſon of the ſtrong freſhoale that commeth out, as alſo becauſe it is very ſhoale: with ſhipps that draw 8 foote water, you muſt have at leaſt 3 quarters of the flood before you can goe in.</p>

If you come from the weſt or the north, you may boldly without feare runne alongſt the ſhoare, &amp; about the poynt upon your lead, without comming neere the towne, you may ſee any thing that might doe you hurt, comming by Greencaſtle, there may you anchor ſo that you may ſee Withcaſtle without the poynt of Green-caſtle, there you may lye within the Towns, ſheltred for windes out of the ſea.</p>

                     <p>The pennes lye off from the maine land, ſoutheaſt two leagues into the ſea. For to ſayle in there, you muſt come in there from the eaſtwards, and run alongſt by the ſtrand of the maine land, leaving all the rocks on the larboard ſide, untill that you come to a great rock, which you muſt leave on the ſtarboard ſide, and runne about to the ſouthwards of it (being paſt it, edge within it up towards the Northweſt, and you may anchor there a little within, in three fathom at low water, lying there, you can ſee no ſea, but at high water the ſea cometh very much tumbling in through the Rocks: You may goe away from thence at high water ſoutheaſt through the Rocks into ſea, but you muſt take very good heed, becauſe it is there full of Rocks where of ſome are above water, and ſome under water.

                     <p>Betwixt the Iſland Mutton and Glenant lyeth a rock, for to avoyd it (for them which will ſaile through there betwixt them) they muſt leave one third part of the channel towards Glenant, and the other two third parts towards Mutton, and then they may boldly run through there without feare.</p>

The marks for to ſayle in there are theſe, there lyeth a little Iſland within in the middeſt of the haven, which you may ſee when you are without the Haven. To the eaſtwards of that little Iſland upon the maine land, ſtandeth an Abbey; bring that Abbey right to the eaſt poynt of the haven, which lyeth within the Baers, and ſayle in with it, untill you come thwart of the eaſt poynt within the Baers, and runne in about by it: being within it, there it is wide and broad, you may anchor there before the foreſayd little Iſland in 5 or 6 fathom, there it is at low water 3 or 4 fathom deepe, or elſe men commonly runne in about, by the poynt, untill they come in the oaze.</p>
                     <p>From the Pennes unto Bell-Iſle, the courſe is eaſtſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt twenty leagues, but from Groy to Bell-Iſle it is ſouhſoutheaſt five leagues.

                     <p>FRom the eaſt poynt of the Cardinall to the River of Roche Barnard, the courſe right northeaſt: there lyeth a little Iſland about halfe wayes betwixt the Cardinall and the foreſayd river ot rather nearer the Cardinall then the River (for when men are by the River, they can but even ſee the foreſayd little Iſland) men runne with the foreſayd courſe of northeaſt cloſe alongſt to the weſtwards, of that little Iſland, and ſhall fall a little to the northwards of the river, run then within a Cables length alongſt by the ſhoare unto it, untill that the river doe open it ſelfe, and then ſayle in amids the channel, &amp; give the rocks a birth that lie at the eaſter ſhoare. Being come within the rocks, you may anchor there, or elſe ſayle on againſt the ſhoare on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, &amp; ſo may ſave ſhip and goods without anchor or cable, if there ſhould be ſuch need. At low water with an ordinary tyde, there is about eleven, and with a ſpring nine foot water; with an ordinary tyde it floweth there about a fathom, but with ſpring 2 fathom up and downe: the entring of the river lyeth in eaſt &amp; by ſouth. A little to the eaſtwards of the rivers mouth, lyeth a great rock which at high water is covered.</p>
                     <p>Hee that commeth from the River of Nantes, and is bound to Roche Barnard, &amp; is not well acquainted there betwixt both, let him runne ſo farre to ſeawards of the Cardinall (when hee is to the weſtwards of the Four) untill that hee run about a ſeaboard of that foreſayd little Iſland (lying halfe wayes betwixt the Cardinal &amp; the River of Roche Barnard) then goeth he ſurely cleare of all the foule ground and other dangers, men may ſayle cloſe alongſt by it to the weſtwards, but to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, of it lye many Rockes and ſhoals.</p>
                     <p>Hee that will ſayle alongſt to the eaſtwards or to the northwards of it, muſt leave about 2 third parts of the water to the Iſland, and one third part towards the land, &amp; ſo runne through betwixt them, but muſt looke out well.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt the rivers of Roche Bernard and Nantes, lieth Old-downes, Croiſill, or Croſwyck, and Poelgem. Croſwyck<note place="margin">Croſwyck</note> hath two poynts, within the northweſt Poynt lyeth the great village of Croſwyck, which hath a thick tower, &amp; there is a great in draught like a haven, where men may goe to anchor in five, ſix or ſeven fathom: to the weſtwards of it ſtandeth alſo a flat Church upon the high land. The land of Olddownes<note place="margin">Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downes.</note> lyeth a little to the northwards of the Church. Poelgem<note place="margin">Poelgem.</note> is a village to the eaſtwards of Croſwyck, with a high ſharpe Tower.</p>
                     <p>About two leagues from the land ſouthweſt and by ſouth from Croſwyck, and weſt and by ſouthſoutherly from the e. point of Poelgem, lyeth a great bank, called the Four,<note place="margin">The Four</note> which at ſome places falleth dry at low water, and lyeth from BellIſle near about eaſt &amp; lyeth the longeſt way ſouthweſt and northeaſt.</p>
                     <p>If you will ſayle from Bell-Iſle to the river of Nantes,<note place="margin">For to ſail into the River of Nantes.</note> then goe away from the eaſt end of the Cardinall, or from the eaſtermoſt rocks that lye of from the Cardinall, directly e.n.e. towards the weſt poynt of Croſwyck, for to ſaile a weather of the foreſayd Four, ſo long untill it begin to ſhoale, and that the ſharp tower of Poelgem commeth againſt the higheſt of the eaſt poynt of Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyck, then you runne alongſt to the northwards of the foreſayd banck, goe then e.ſ.e. or according as the wind is eaſt &amp; by ſouth, &amp; e.ſ.e. unto the Rock with the hole, called Pierre-perce,<note place="margin">Pierre-Perce.</note> but ſo that you come not very neare (at low water) the land ſomwhat to the weſtwards of Poelgem, for it is not cleane alongſt by it. Betwixt the Four and the point of Croſwyck it is in the fareway 8, 9, and 10 fathom deepe.</p>
                     <p>From the poynt of Poelgem eaſtwards lye ſome little Iſlands and Rocks, which are very foule, come not very neare them, nor the ſhoare thereabouts. If it ſhould happen that you ſhould turne to windwards, for at low water there falleth many of the rocks dry, when you come neare the rock with the hole) then run alongſt to the northwards of it, and run in very cloſe by it, leaving it on the ſtarboard ſide of you for to avoyd the foule grounds, which lye off from the poynt of Poelgem towards this rock. Cloſe alongſt by this rock it is foure fathom deepe. Being paſt this Rock with the hole, then runne all alongſt by the north ſhoare, unto S. Nazare<note place="margin">S. Nazare</note> in three or foure fathom at low water, but you muſt take heed of a rocky poynt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the weſtwards of S. Nazare, the markes thereof are theſe: There ſtandeth a mill upon the high land, ſomewhat farre within the land, when that commeth over a countrey-mans houſe, which ſtandeth below by the river, then are you thwart of the rocks, being paſt them, keep yet the north ſhoare, and runne alongſt by it, untill you come within the poynt of S. Nazare, and anchor there in 6 or 7 fathom. In the middeſt of the river betwixt the foreſayd rocks with the hole, and S.

Upon the foreſaid Barre is at high water and Spring tyde, at leaſt three fathom, with an ordinary tyde two fathom and a halfe, but at low water no more then 3 foot water. When you come about the point, you muſt ſayle up to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, keeping about the middle of the channell alongſt the river, or rather neareſt the weſt ſide, for to avoide ſome foule ground and ſhoale, that lie on the eaſt ſide, and anchor before the town in foure, five, or ſixe fathom.

                     <p>A little within this Barre on the north ſide of the river lieth up to the northwards, a great water within, of 7 leagues long, and falleth out into Sea by Cabritton.

At high water, and with an ordinary tyde, there commeth nine foote, but with a ſpring twelve foote water, at low water it falleth altogether dry, ſo that men may goe over there with drie feete. A little within the weſt point of the Bay is alſo a little Dock, where there is a foot water more then in the foreſaid tyde-haven, but it falleth alſo dry at low water.</p>
                     <p>This Bay is very good to know by theſe marks that hereafter are written: It lyeth right in the Bight, to the eaſtwardes of it lyeth the land north and by eaſt towards Bayone, and to the weſtwardes of it the land falleth away ſouthweſt nnd by weſt, and ſouthweſt towards Fonteravia. Upon the eaſt poynt of the Bay ſtandeth a white Fire-tower, which men may ſee farre off, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Sunne ſhineth upon it, then it ſhineth very white more then the other land. Upon the weſt poynt ſtandeth a flat white houſe a little wayes upon the high land, to the weſtwardes of the Bay it is upon the ſea ſide gray and blewiſh land. Alſoo the high hill of S. John de Luz, is a good marke for to know this Bay, which remaineth in ſayling in, lying ſomewhat to the eaſtwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, or on the larboard ſide. This foreſayd hill of S. John de Luz ſheweth it ſelfe out in height above all other hilles thereabouts, &amp; thereby is very good to be knowne above upon the top it is ſomewhat flat, as is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the riſing of the lands. Upon this foreſayd hill ſtandeth a Chappell, from whence men may ſee into foure Kingdomes: France, Spaine, Navarre, and Arragon.</p>
                     <p>About two leagues ſouthweſt and ſouthweſt and by weſt from S. John de Luz, lye the rocks called the Pignons of S. Anna,<note place="margin">Pignons of S. Anna</note> not farre from land: a league to the weſtwards of them lyeth the Bay of Fonteravia, being a faire Bay.</p>
                     <p>At the weſt poynt of the Bay lyeth the C. Figure, a high poynt, upon it ſtandeth a caſtle, &amp; to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it a little chappel. At the poynt of this cape lyeth a rock a little wayes from it, but the ſea cannot runne through betwixt them, except it be with very high floods, it breaketh a little through. At the eaſt ſide of this bay lye two high rocks, and thwart of them lye alſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170755:219"/> ſome low rocks a good wayes off from the land. For to avoyd them you muſt ſayle in by the weſt poynt for to come into this Bay, and being within it, you may anchor in eight or nine fathom, but ſo that the foreſayd great rock at the C. Figuer ſtand northnorthweſt from you, there you lye in faire ſandy ground, and landlockt for a northweſt winde. The Kroonenbrough<note place="margin">Kroonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berch.</note> lyeth about halfe wayes betwixt S. John de Luz and this foreſayd Bay of Fonteravia.</p>
                     <p>A little league to the weſtwards of C. de Figuer, lieth Paſſage<note place="margin">Paſſagie.</note> alſo a faire haven At the weſt ſide of the havens mouth, which is very narrow, lyeth a round rock, ſo that it is evill to come in there with an ebb, but with a flood it is better, without it is very cleane, without any ſhoale or fowle grounds, but onely the foreſayd rounde rocke. The towne lyeth a little within the haven on the w. ſide, where men doe lye before it in 7 fathom.</p>
                     <p>Two great leagues to the weſtwardes of Paſſage, lyeth S. Sebaſtians, betwixt both is alſo a ſand-bay in a bight, where there goeth up into the land a ſhoale little river, where come in many Barkes.</p>
                     <p>The haven of Saint Sebaſtians<note place="margin">S. Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> is good for to come into, men doe runne in there betwixt two little caſtles, where of the eaſtermoſt is the greates, ſtanding upon a high hill. The weſtermoſt is a little ſquare Tower, and lyeth upon a little Iſland, or rock. In the havens mouth being narrow, betwixt the two foreſayd little Caſtles, lyeth a rocke, which at low water is ſixe fathom deepe, and when it is a ſtorme out of the ſea, it breaketh allwayes upon it, and lyeth neereſt the eaſt-land, by the weſt-land it is deepe ten fathom. Now for to avoyd the foreſayd rocke in comming in, there commeth an Abbey to the eaſtwards of the weſtermoſt Iſland, &amp; a liitle Tower. If you keepe them one in the other, then you run into eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it.</p>
                     <p>For to anchor without S. Sebaſtians in the road, you muſt keepe the high hill which lyeth upon the poynt of Cape Figuer, without the foreſayd eaſtermoſt caſtle, there you may anchor, but if the ſame come to be hidden behind the caſtle or Iſland, then you may not anchor in the road of S. Sebaſtians. When you are come through the narrow within the rock and the caſtles, then you may anchor at the eaſt ſide under the great caſtle, there is the beſt road. Within the foreſayd caſtle goeth up a little water, men may goe at low water on foot from the eaſter caſtle alongſt a high ſtrand upon the maine land, unto the Towne, which lyeth behinde the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd high hill with the Caſtle, yet the ſtrand at high water is covered; it is a bay, and within before the towne it is deepe five, ſixe, and ſeven fathom, at the weſt ſide under the little Iſland, men may not anchor, becauſe it is flat and ſhoale there.</p>
                     <p>He that will goe forth from thence into S. Sebaſtians. let him run in, keeping the middle channell, betwixt the two Iſlands, and let him leave the little Iſland where upon the chappel ſtandeth on the ſtarboard ſide, running in ſo right againſt the firſt or the ſecond wall of the towne, and anchor there, the boats or ſhallops ſhall come aboard of him, and helpe him into the haven betwixt the walles.</p>
                     <p>A league to the weſtwardes of S. Sebaſtians, lyeth a ſandbay, where men may anchor ſo deep and ſo ſhallow as they will.</p>

Upon the weſt poynt of this bay of Tanger, ſtandeth a Caſtle ſomewhat high, and yet ſomewhat higher upon the high land, ſtandeth a little watch-tower: but to the eaſtwards of Tanger ſtandeth alſoo an old ruinous watch-tower, whereby Tanger is very eaſy to be knowne. From Tanger to Ape-hill, the coaſt lyeth moſt e.n.e, and e. &amp; by north, is the right courſe for to ſayle through the Strait. If you will ſail into the Strait by night, then keepe to the Barbary coaſt, which is very cleane, and there you can take no hurt: but the Spaniſh coaſt is fowle, as is befote ſayd. They that will ſayle alongſt by the Spaniſh coaſt, they muſt goe cloſe alongſt by the ſhoare, and runne through betwixt the Iſland Tariffe and the foreſayd fowle grounds, cloſe alongſt by the Iſland, or els muſt keepe farre off from the Iſland, for to runne alongſt without the ſhoals; but in the middeſt, neere a like unto both lands it is beſt.</p>

                     <p>At Gibraltar is a faire Bay almoſt like a haven: if you will anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, then ſaile ſo farre into it, untill that innermoſt point of the hill of Gibralter, doe ſtand eaſt from you, thereabouts it is deepe 5 or 6 fathom, and clean ground: towards the mill it is ſhoal water of 3 fathom.

                        <note place="margin">Bay off Gibraltar.</note>When you will ſet ſaile from the road of Gibraltar with an eaſterly wind, it is good to beare up ſomewhat before the wind towards the weſt ſhoare, &amp; then forth out alongſt by the lee ſhoare, for the eaſterly winds do fall with ſuch whirling &amp; fore-ſlaughes from over the high land of Gibraltar, that you ſhall be hardly able to get out of the Bay alongſt by the high land. When you come from the eaſtwards, &amp; will ſayle out through the Straits, and that you are ſomwhat neere to the Spaniſh coaſt, then you muſt be very carefull, for that you bring the hill of Gibraltar, againſt the high land of Barbary, &amp; in regard the land to the northwards of Gibraltarhil is low, it ſeemeth (to look to) to be nothing els, then as if there were the opening of the Straites. It hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happened, that ſome which have ſo miſtaken it, have ſayled into the bay, thinking it to be the opening of the Strait, &amp; ſo have loſt their ſhips there. Therefore it is very needfull, that men take great care not to miſtake them ſelves of the hill of Gibraltar, &amp; if men do take heed of it, it is eaſy to bee knowne.</p>
                     <p>Eſtepona lieth 5 leagues to the eaſtwards or to the northwards of Gibraltar, betwixt them both ſtand divers firetowrs upon the coaſt, there is clean ground for to anchor. If you will anchor to the eaſtwardes of Gibraltar, by the next tower of Gibraltar, then bring Gibraltar ſouthſouthweſt from you, and anchor in 25 fathom, there is cleane ground, &amp; blackſand but if you will anchor by the ſecond firetower, there is a valley, &amp; there you may fetch water, and anchor in 20 or 22 fathom, there is a valley, and there is alſo clean ground, and better lying for to ſet ſail with eaſterly winds, for thoſe that are bound out of the Strait. Before Eſtepona, men may anchor in 14 fathom, that is a place for to lade fruite and wines; 5 or 6 leagues to the eaſtwards of it lieth Marveles, betwixt them both ſtand 5 watch towers upon the coaſt.</p>

Right before Marveles, the ground is not cleane. About a ſhot of a Caſt peece to the weſtwards of the town, men may fetch freſh water.</p>

Comming then about by the point of Seuta, you ſhall ſee out a head a black point called cape Porkes lying ſouth from the poynt of Seuta. When men lye in the Bay of Gibraltar, they may ſee the foreſayd cape Porkes<note place="margin">C.

It hath happened that ſome ſhips have anchored there, but their anchors fell ſo into the rocks, that they could not weigh them again, but muſt hew of their cables, and leave their anchors behinde them. Therefore if you come off from the point of Cape Porques, then bee care full that you bring the foreſayd firſt little hommock (which lyeth a ſtearn of you in the bight of Seuta to the ſouthwards of Seuta) a little without the Cape Porques, and ſo keep ſailing to the ſouthward, and keep heaving of the lead continually without ceaſing untill that you get the ſoft ground, ſo ſoone as you ſhall feele it, let then preſently your anchor fal, for the place where the ſoft ground is, is not two cables length in compaſſe great.</p>

Before Mamora is a high broad ſandſtrand, and is not eaſy to know, when you are ſomewhat off the land The beſt knowledge thereof is this: When you come from the northwards alongſt the ſhoare, you have all high land within, that you come leeſe when you come before Mamora, and when you come from the northwards, you cannot ſee the river of Mamora open before you bee paſt it, by reaſon that it lyeth into the eaſtwards, &amp; the n. point is low. When you come ſomewhat cloſe by the ſhoare, you ſhall ſee upon the high land in the Caſtle of Mamora (which the Spaniards have built there for the defence of the place) a very high maſt or ſtake, which you may ſee indifferent far off, and when it is cleare weather you may ſee alſo the high thick Tower of Salley to the ſouthwards ſtand againſt the land. Before the river lieth a Barre which with a Spring hath 16 &amp; 17 foote, and ſometimes more water, the Barre is oftentimes altered by the ſea. In the ſpring it lieth in commonly e.ſ.e. &amp; there abouts. In the later part of the yeare it lyeth in more eaſterly by the caſting up of the ſea out of the n. In the Summer the windes blow alongſt the coaſt, the moſt part of the time out of the north, which cauſeth that the current run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there to the ſouthwards, &amp; in the winter they blow much &amp; ſtrong out of the ſouthweſt and ſouthſouthweſt In the winter men muſt be very carefull to get of betimes when the winde beginneth to come to the ſouth, or ſ.e. then it is time to get of, for then commonly it ſhifteth to the ſ. w. and w. ſ. w. with foule weather, but when it commeth about againe to the weſtnorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt or northweſt, then it is like to be good weather againe.</p>

There goeth a wall round about the high thick Tower, and lieth upon a point on the ſ. ſide within the River. Before the River is a Barre which oftentimes with ſtorms out of the ſea doth alter and ſhift, and is caſt too, ſometimes the channell runneth by one of the two poynts, &amp; ſometimes againe right in the middeſt of the rivers mouth. Hee that will anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Salley, let him bring the foreſayd high thick Tower (which ſtandeth within on the River) on the poynt of the caſtle, to wit, over the ſouth point of the River, which ſhall then ſtand from him neere about ſouth e. &amp; anchor there in thirty, eight and twenty, 24, 20, 18, or 16 fathom, ſo neere or farre off as he will there is clean black ſandy-ground, nevertheleſſe that the ſhoare thereabouts is ſo full of rocks &amp; ſtones.

                     <p>The C. Cantin<note place="margin">C.

If you come from the northwards, or from C. Vincent, and are bound to Saffia, then ſet your courſe ſouth and ſ. and by eaſt, and then you ſhall fall with the land 4 or 5 leag. to the e. wards of C. Cantin, or if you ſayle a more weſterly courſe you ſhall runne till you come in the height of 32 degr, &amp; a half, and then the C.

If you fall to the eaſtwards of the C. the coaſt lyeth there ſ.w. and by w. and w. ſ. w. and it is even plaine land. About 10 leag. to the e. wards of the C. lieth that little town Tyro, with a high white tower upon the ſea ſide, &amp; 5 or 6 leag. more to the weſtwards (betwixt Caſa Cavalgero and C. Cantin) you ſhall ſee a little bight or Bay, thereabouts lie upon the ſtrand by the water ſide, great black rockes, which ſhew as if they were wrakes of ſhips, and then forth alongſt to the C. it is a faire flat ſandy ſtrand. From the C. ſhooteth off a ledge of rocks ſomewhat off into ſea, which men muſt avoid when they ſayle about the Cape.</p>
                     <p>From C. Cantin to the north poynt of Saffia, the coaſt lieth ſ. or ſomewhat more weſterly, 5 or 6 leag. betwixt

A league to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the C. lieth a riffe or ſhoale by the ſhoare, by ſome called the Gold-banke and lyeth about a league off from the land: at ſometimes of the year there is much fiſh to be taken.</p>
                     <p>To the ſouthwards of the Bay of Saffia<note place="margin">Saffia.</note> is high uneven, and moſt of all double land, but to the ſouthwards of it, it is even &amp; plain, thereby men may eaſily perceive or diſcern whether they be to the northwards of Saffia, or to the ſouthwards of it.</p>
                     <p>If you will anchor in the bay<note place="margin">For to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the Bay.</note> or road before Saffia,<note place="margin">Saffia.</note> then bring the north poynt (whereupon ſtandeth a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer) a little more weſterly then n. from you, &amp; anchor then in 18 fathom. Or if you will anchor further in the Bay, then bring the foreſayd north poynt n.n.w. or a little more northerly from you, and then the northermoſt of the two north points ſhall bee a ſhippes length without the ſouthermoſt or the next unto you run then ſo farre to the ſouthwards untill that the tower were men doe land with the boats (which is a high ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re tower ſtanding below even within the wal of the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne) come right over a tower which is faſt to the wall, which commeth off from the Caſtle above to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſo that the foreſaid thicke tower below come right over the Haven, betwixt the poynt where the caſtle ſtandeth upon the water ſide, and the rocks where men goe in betwixt. Or elſe anchor that the high Caſtle of Saffia ſtand e. and by ſ. and e.ſ.e. from you, there it is 16, 17 and 18 fathom deepe, good fine ſandy ground. You may alſo anchor ſo farre within in the Bay in 15 &amp; 16 fathom, that the north poynt come to be n. w. &amp; n. w. &amp; by n. from you. Theſe are the Summer road, in the Winter you men muſt anchor further from the land in 28 or 30 fathom, there the ground is courſe ſand. Men may boldly run in before Saffia into the road by night, there is nothing that they need to feare, which may doe them hurt, but the land.</p>
                     <p>About two leagues from Saffia, lyeth the ſouth point of the bay, which is a low point that lieth out, and two leagues to the ſouthwards of it lieth another ſteep rocky point without ſandy ſtrand. By it goeth in the River Tanſit up into the land unto Marrocos.</p>
                     <p>From the poynt of Saffia to the Iſland Mogodor, the coaſt lyeth ſouthſouthweſt 19 or 20 leagues.</p>

It is there in comming in, betwixt the Iſland and the Rockes five fathom deep. Within the foreſayd Rocks lye alſo ſome other Rockes on the larboard ſide, which at high water are under water, and at low water are uncovered. When you come to the end of them, you may luffe up about by them towards the maine land, and anchor there within them in 3 fathom at low water, there is good ſand-ground. But yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is not there very good lying, for by reaſon of the breaking of the Sea upon the foreſayd rocks, there goeth ſometimes a great Sea, ſo that it is not good lying there with a ſtorme, but further in, under the Iſland it is good lying in two fathom and a halfe. From the ſouth-end of the Iſland lyeth off a little riffe towards the maine land almoſt to the foot ſtrand, and to the ſ. wards off that foreſayd little riffe, lyeth a bancke off from the maine land almoſt a league off into ſea.

                     <head>The ſecond Demonſtration, In Which Are to be ſeene the Canary Iſlands.</head>
                     <p>THe chiefeſt Iſlands of the Canaries are 7 in number, Lancerota, Forteventura, or Porte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventura, great Canaries, Teneriffe, Gomera, Palma, and Ferro. The Iſland Lancerota lyeth from Cape S. Vincent ſouthſouthweſt diſtant about 165 leagues. It hath one haven upon the northeaſt end, betwixt the two Iſlands Alagranca and Gratioſa, where men may come in from the northwards &amp; lye landlockt for all winds, it is deep there 10, 15, and 20 fathom, and they may ſayle out again to the ſouthwards along by Lancerota. At the eaſt ſide of Lancerota is a good road before the Towne of Lancerota, there lyeth a banck to the northwards of it, which men muſt avoyd, and run about to the ſouthwards of it, there they may anchor in 10, 11, and 12 fathom: on the ſame ſoutheaſt ſide lye alſo two bad havens a great ſhot of a caſt peece one from the other, the northermoſt is called Porto de Naos, &amp; the ſouthermoſt Porto de Cavallos, which we have demonſtrated in a large volume in the northweſt corner of this card, &amp; ſhewed the depths with number of feet at high water &amp; ſpring-tide.</p>
                     <p>Porto de Naos, the deepeſt of theſe bad-havens, goeth in northweſt and by north betwixt two ledges of rockes, there ſtand two beacons of heapes of ſtones, in manner as the warders of Norway, which you muſt bring and keepe one in the other, and ſayle ſo right in through betwixt the two foreſayd ledges of rockes. The ſhoaleſt of the Barre betwixt the two ledges of rockes, is but a ſhort ſpace, a great ſhippes length long and is deepe at high watet 17 foot, &amp; at low water ſeven foot, ſo ſoone as you ſhall be over, it will preſently bee 20, 24, 26, &amp; 28 foot deep, then you muſt edge up n. and then preſently northeaſt &amp; anchor behinde the rockes which lye to the northwards of the Barre, in the Channell the ground is rocky, hard, &amp; uneven. If a ſhip ſhould come to ſtrike there, it ſhould preſently be broken. The ledge is ſo without as it is within, very ſteep, ſoo that you may come very cloſe unto it, where the anchors ſtand marked, it is altogether cleane ſandy ground, 30 &amp; 34 foot deep at high water with a ſea wind there can goe here a great ſea, but that happeneth ſeldome, for the winds; doe blow moſt out of the n. &amp; n.e. and therefore it is almoſt alwayes there ſmooth water. This haven is very narrow betwixt the rockes; which lye to ſeawards of you &amp; the ſhoare, it is but a little more then a great cables length broad, and from the havens mouth to the main land about a Cables length &amp; a halfe. The Havens mouth alſo is not broad, but at high water the rockes doe flow a good wayes on both ſides under water, which at low water againe are uncovered.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Porto de Naos and Porto de Cavallos lye two little Iſlands, the northermoſt is the greateſt, at high water men may goe through with boats within the Iſlands, into Porto de Cavallos, but not with ſhips for at low water it falleth dry there within. Upon the ſouthermoſt little Iſland ſtandeth an old Caſtle fallen downe, which heretofore hath beene ſpoyled by Engliſhmen. From the ſouth ſide of that little Iſland ſhooteth off a riffe, &amp; to the ſouthwards or the w. wards of it lyeth in the Barre, which is very narrow, not above ten fathom broad, upon the maine land ſtand alſo two little beakons, as at Porto de Naos, which you muſt bring one in the other, and ſaile ſo right in. At high water and ſpring-tide there is no more then twelve foot water, or an halfe foot more, the ground in the havens mouth is alſo hard, &amp; nothing elſe then rocks, where you muſt goe in over but within it is cleane ſandy ground where you may lye a ground without any danger, with a ſhippe that draweth tenne or eleven foot water. At the higheſt water the moſt part of the rockes on both ſides of the Havens mouth, lye under water, ſo that at many places men may goe over them with boats. At low water there remaineth in this Havens mouth no more then a foot, or a foot and a halfe depth, ſo that a ſhippes boat cannot goe in; within men lye landlockt for all windes, and although it blow very hard, yet the water is alwayes ſmooth. In both theſe havens a ſouth and by weſt and north and by eaſt moone maketh high water. Neare the Havens there are no houſes where Spaniards or Moores doe dwell, then only by Porto de Cavallos a little Church, where they have Maſſe ſayd on Sundayes, when ſhippes lie there. Men go from thence betwixt the Mountaines to the town, which lieth 3 leag. from thence. He that wil come here muſt provide himſelfe with freſh water, for there is very ſeldom freſh water to be gotten. Upon this land there groweth neither fruit nor wine. In ſome good years it giveth out Wheat, Bally, &amp; Orſilly, the Inhabitants are Moore under the command of the King of Spaine.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Lancerota and Forteventure lyeth a little lIſand called Iſle de Lobos, which is on the outer ſide, to wit, on the n. weſt ſide, very foule. Men may anchor on both ſides of that Iſland in 15 or 20 fathom, alſo in ſix fathom a ſhot of a caſt peece ſouthweſt and by weſt from the weſt point off the Iſland, there men may lye land-lockt for all windes, except for a northnorthweſt and ſoutheaſt windes. The coaſt of Forteventura is at the northeaſt end very foule, with many riffes that lye out, whereupon the ſea doth break exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>The Iſland of great Canaries lieth from Forteventura weſt 19 or 20 leagues diſtant. The road there lyeth, at the eaſt ſide of the Iſland, behinde the n.e. point, thwart off a Caſtle that ſtandeth upon a Chindle. The foreſaid northeaſt point, is a very high point, with a long ſmall and low ſandſtrand faſt to the other land, ſo that when it is five or ſixe leagues northweſt or ſouthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt from you it ſeemeth to be an Iſland aſunder off from the other land. If you deſire to go in there into the road, then ſaile about by that northeaſt point, alongſt by the Iſolettes, leaving them on the ſtarboard ſide of you untill that the Caſtle do lie near about northweſt and by north from you, anchor there in eight, nine, ten, or twelve fathom, then lieth the north point northeaſt and by north and the ſouth poynt ſouthſoutheaſt from you.</p>
                     <p>At the ſouth end of the great Canaries is a faire ſand-bay called Maſpalomba, there is a good road for ſoutherly windes, &amp; freſh water to be gotten.</p>
                     <p>The north point of the great Canaries, and the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt point of Teneriffe called Punte de Nago, lie weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northweſt, and eaſtſoutheaſt diſtant 21 leagues. In Teneriffe is a road on the ſoutheaſt ſide before the town S. Cruz, there is a faire ſand-bay, a little to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the town is the beſt road in 20, or 24 fathom, and then Punte de Nago, the northeaſt point of Teneriffe lieth northnortheaſt from you, and the ſouth point ſouth and by weſt. When the Pico of Teneriffe is weſtſouthweſt from you, then are you open before this road of S. Cruz, and when you lye in the road of S. Cruz, you may ſee the Iſland of great Canaries ſoutheaſt from you about 13 leagues.</p>
                     <p>On the northweſt ſide of Teneriffe lieth the road of Garrichica, from the northeaſt point Punte de Nago weſtſouthweſt and ſouthweſt &amp; by weſt eight or nine leagues; He that will anchor before Garrichica, let him anchor to the weſtwards of the rock with the croſſe called the Lion, ſo that the foreſayd rock do lie ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170755:256"/> and by eaſt and ſoutheaſt from him, then he ſhall lie right before the towne, and may ſee right into the ſtreet of the town, through the Cloiſter of S. Dominicus, there is clean ground in 36 or 40 fathom, the Pieck lieth then over the w. ſide off the town, nearer to the land, or to the rock then in 35 or 36 fathom it is not cleane, &amp; weſtwards towards the riffe Lapania it is alſo foule ground. This is a dangerous road, therefore every one that commeth here, muſt be very carefull to have their anchors, cables, and ſailes very preedy and ready for to ſhift roads as ſoon as it beginneth to be a ſtorme.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a little haven before Garrichica, where men may lie with a few ſhips. For to ſayle in there, you muſt have a Pilot. On the weſt ſide of the havens mouth lieth a rock under water, but the ſea breaketh alwayes upon it, you may anchor within in the haven in five or ſix fathom, and muſt bring two anchors out a head to ſeawards, with a cable on the rocks, and an anchor out a ſtearn, on the land, ſo that the ſhips cannot wend too and again, the ground is there foule, you muſt buye up your cables with buyes and cask for to keep them from the ground. This is a good haven in Summer, then it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good weather, but in the winter it is not good to com in there with a ſhip, for the grown ſea out of the n. weſt commeth running in there ſometimes ſo forcible and ſtrong, that it is not poſſible to hold a ſhip, although ſhe had to anchors out. It hath hapned certain years paſt that there was loſt in the ſame haven a great many ſhips; and a great many houſes of the ſame towne waſhed away with the great water.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Garrichica and the eaſt end of Teneriffe, are three lading places more for to lade wine at, as Maramela Relecho, and Oratama.</p>
                     <p>At the ſouthweſt end of Teneriffe lieth alſo another little haven or Bay where is much wines laden called Adeſſa, there is alſo good lying except it be with a ſ.w. winde, which bloweth there open in.</p>
                     <p>From Teneriffe to the Iſland la Palma, the courſe is weſtnorthweſt twenty leagues. On the ſoutheaſt ſide la Palma, lieth a faire Bay, with a town and lade-place called S. Cruz. He that commeth from the northwards, and deſireth to anchor in the road, let him run ſo far in the Bay untill he be to the ſouthwards, or paſt the head, or the bridge, and anchor there in 25 or 30 fathom. In winter time men muſt not anchor ſo near the ſtrand, becauſe of the ſoutheaſt or ſouthſoutheaſt windes, for then they ſhould lie too near the ſtrand. Men lye there moored with two anchors for the ſea winde, with a ſmall anchor out a ſtearn for to keep the ſhip right in the road there lyeth to the eaſtwards of the towne a high white rock with a croſſe, there is the beſt road. A little to the northwards of the town, is a faire ſand-bay, there is good anchoring in 20, 30, or 35 fathom, according as men will lye far off, the Road is called the Rammell road. When men lie in the road of Palma, they may ſee the Pieck of Teneriffe lie eaſtſoutheaſt from them. The Iſland Palma is very high and full of trees, whereby it is eaſy to bee known.</p>
                     <p>On the ſouthweſt ſide of la Palma is another place, where men lade wines called Taſſa Corda.</p>
                     <p>About 5 leagues weſt from the weſt end of Teneriffe, lieth the Iſland Gomera, which hath on the n. e. ſide a good haven of 10 fathom deep, where is good lying almoſt for all windes, better then in any of the other Iſlands, but there is nothing to lade: Men may alſoo anchor without before the haven in 20 fathom, but they muſt ſhift roads there as at Garrichica.</p>
                     <p>The road of Adeſſa in Teneriffe lieth right over againſt it, eaſt off from it about 5 leagues.</p>
                     <p>The road of Palma lyeth from this haven in Gomera northweſt and by north 16 leagues.</p>
                     <p>The Iſland Ferro lieth from the Iſland Palma ſouth and by weſt, diſtant 13 leagues.</p>
